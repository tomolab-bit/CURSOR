Hanoi , July 21 , 2017


To: Government Office

The State Bank of Vietnam received Official Letter No. 7061/DMDN dated July 6 , 2017 from the Government Office requesting the State Bank of Vietnam to consider, process and respond to Mr. Vu Thai Ha regarding the proposal related to the design of a computer center to mine Bitcoin, Litecoin and other virtual currencies. After studying, based on the functions and tasks, the State Bank of Vietnam has the following opinions:

- Clause 2, Article 17 of the Law on the State Bank of Vietnam 2010 stipulates: " Paper money and metal money issued by the State Bank are legal means of payment in the territory of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam ".

- Clause 6, 7, Article 4 of Decree 101/2012/ND-CP dated November 22, 2012 of the Government on non - cash payment (amended and supplemented by Decree 80/2016/ND-CP) stipulates : “ 6. Non-cash payment means used in payment transactions (hereinafter referred to as payment means), including : Checks , payment orders , payment authorizations, collections, collection authorizations, bank cards and other payment means as prescribed by the State Bank. 7. Illegal payment means are payment means not specified in Clause 6 of this Article . ”

- Clause 6, Article 6 of Decree 101/2012/ND-CP (amended and supplemented by Decree 80/2016/ND-CP) stipulates prohibited acts: “ 6. Issuing, supplying and using illegal means of payment ”.

Based on the above provisions, virtual currency in general and Bitcoin , Litecoin in particular are not currencies and are not legal means of payment under the provisions of Vietnamese law. The issuance, supply and use of virtual currency in general and Bitcoin, Litecoin in particular (illegal means of payment) as currency or means of payment is prohibited. Sanctions for this act have been stipulated in Decree 96/2014/ND-CP of the Government on administrative sanctions in the field of currency and banking and the 2015 Penal Code (amended and supplemented). In addition, regarding investment in virtual currency, the State Bank of Vietnam has repeatedly warned that this investment poses great risks to investors.

Mr. Vu Thai Ha's petition is related to investing in Bitcoin and Litecoin mining through importing a large number of computers, not related to the use of virtual currency as a means of payment. Therefore, based on Article 4 of the Law on the State Bank of Vietnam 2010 and related legal provisions, the State Bank of Vietnam has no functions or duties related to state management of Mr. Vu Thai Ha's planned investment activities.

Therefore, regarding investment in mining Bitcoin and Litecoin as an asset or commodity through importing computers, the State Bank of Vietnam requests the Government Office to consult the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Industry and Trade to respond to Mr. Vu Thai Ha.

Above is the opinion of the State Bank of Vietnam sent to the Government Office./ .
