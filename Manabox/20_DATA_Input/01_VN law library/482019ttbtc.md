### Article 4. Provision for inventory price reduction

1. Objects for setting up provisions include raw materials, materials, tools, equipment, goods, goods in transit, goods sent for sale, goods in bonded warehouses, finished products (hereinafter referred to as inventories) whose original price recorded in the accounting books is higher than the net realizable value and ensures the following conditions:

- Have legal invoices and documents as prescribed by the Ministry of Finance or other reasonable evidence proving the cost of inventory.

Net realizable value of inventories

In there:

- The original cost of inventories is determined according to the provisions of Accounting Standard No. 02 - Inventories issued with Decision No. 149/2001/QD-BTC dated December 31, 2001 of the Minister of Finance and amendments, supplements or replacements (if any).

- The net realizable value of inventories determined by the enterprise itself is the estimated selling price of inventories in the normal production and business period at the time of preparing the annual financial statement minus (-) the estimated cost to complete the product and the estimated cost necessary for consuming them.

3. At the time of preparing the annual financial report, based on documents collected by the enterprise proving that the original price of inventory is higher than the net realizable value of the inventory, based on the provisions in Clause 1 and Clause 2 of this Article, the enterprise shall make provisions for inventory price reduction as follows:

### Article 6. Provision for bad debts

1. The objects of provisioning are receivables (including loans that the enterprise is lending and bonds that have not been registered for trading on the stock market that the enterprise owns) that are overdue for payment and receivables that have not yet reached maturity but are likely to be unable to be collected by the enterprise on time, while ensuring the following conditions:

   - Must have original documents proving the amount of debt that has not been paid, including:

- One of the following original documents: Economic contract, loan agreement, debt commitment;

- Contract termination (if any);

- Debt reconciliation; in case there is no debt reconciliation, there must be a written request for debt reconciliation confirmation or a debt collection document sent by the enterprise (with postmark or confirmation from the delivery unit);

- List of debts;

- Other relevant documents (if any).

   - There is sufficient basis to determine that the debt is bad debt:

- Receivables that are overdue for 06 months or more (calculated according to the original principal repayment period according to the economic contract, loan agreement or other debt commitments, not taking into account the debt repayment extension period between the parties), the enterprise has sent a debt confirmation or payment reminder but has not yet recovered the debt.

- The receivables have not yet reached the payment deadline but the enterprise has collected evidence to determine that the debtor is likely to be unable to pay the debt on time as prescribed in Point c, Clause 2 of this Article.

- Particularly for debts purchased from debt trading enterprises (registered business lines and debt trading activities in accordance with the provisions of law), the overdue period is calculated from the date of transfer of creditor rights between the parties (based on the minutes or notice of transfer of creditor rights) or according to the most recent commitment (if any) between the debtor enterprise and the debt trading enterprise.

2. Provision level:

   - For overdue receivables, the provision level is as follows:

- 30% of the value for receivables overdue from 6 months to less than 1 year.

- 50% of the value for receivables overdue from 1 year to less than 2 years.

- 70% of the value for receivables overdue from 2 years to less than 3 years.

- 100% of the value for receivables 3 years or older.

   - For telecommunications service businesses and retail businesses, receivables from telecommunications, information technology, postpaid television service fees and receivables from retail sales of goods in the form of deferred/installment payments by debtors who are individuals that are overdue for payment, the provision level is as follows:

- 30% of the value for overdue receivables from 3 months to less than 6 months.

- 50% of the value for overdue receivables from 6 months to less than 9 months.

- 70% of the value for overdue receivables from 9 months to less than 12 months.

- 100% of the value for receivables over 12 months.

   - For receivables that have not yet reached the payment deadline but the enterprise has collected evidence to determine that the economic organization has gone bankrupt, has opened bankruptcy proceedings, has fled the business location; the debtor is being prosecuted, detained, tried by law enforcement agencies or is serving a sentence or is suffering from a serious illness (with hospital confirmation) or has died or the debt has been requested by the enterprise to be enforced but cannot be enforced because the debtor has fled the place of residence; the debt has been sued by the enterprise but the case has been suspended, the enterprise will estimate the level of irrecoverable loss (up to the value of the debt being monitored in the accounting books) to set up a provision.

3. At the time of preparing the annual financial report, if receivables are determined to be doubtful, the enterprise must set up provisions according to the provisions in Clause 2 of this Article and the following provisions:

   - If the amount of provision to be set aside is equal to the balance of the provision for bad debts set aside in the previous year's report currently recorded in the accounting books, the enterprise is not allowed to set aside additional provision for bad debts.

   - If the amount of provision to be set aside is higher than the balance of the provision for bad debts set aside in the previous year's report currently recorded in the accounting books, the enterprise shall set aside the difference and record it as an expense for the period.

   - If the amount of provision to be set aside is lower than the balance of the provision for bad debts set aside in the previous year's report currently recorded in the accounting books, the enterprise shall reverse the difference and record a reduction in expenses for the period.

   - Enterprises must estimate the possible loss or the age of overdue debts and make provisions for each bad debt, along with evidence to prove the bad debts mentioned above. After making provisions for each bad debt, enterprises must summarize all provisions for debts in a detailed list to serve as a basis for accounting for the enterprise's expenses.

   - For debt purchased from debt trading enterprises, based on the debt purchase and settlement plan and the principles of provisioning in this Circular, provisioning shall be made. The maximum provisioning amount shall be equal to the amount of money the enterprise has spent to purchase the debt, and the maximum provisioning period shall not exceed the period of enterprise restructuring and debt collection in the debt purchase and settlement plan.

   - Enterprises do not make provisions for overdue receivables arising from profits and dividends distributed from capital contributions to investments in other enterprises.

   - When setting up a provision for bad debts of a debtor that has both receivables and payables, the enterprise shall base on the debt reconciliation minutes between the two parties to set up a provision based on the remaining receivables after offsetting the payables of this debtor.

The provision level for each overdue debt is calculated based on the percentage (%) of the overdue debt that must be provisioned within the prescribed period multiplied (x) by the total debt receivable after offsetting the debt payable.

For example: Company A has generated sales transactions for Company B under each contract and has overdue payments as follows:

+ Sold a batch of goods under contract 01 to Company B, the contract value is 5 million VND, Company B has not paid the debt, 7 months overdue.

+ Sold a batch of goods under contract 02 to Company B, the contract value is 15 million VND, Company B has not paid the debt, overdue for 13 months.

+ Sold a batch of goods under contract 03 to Company B, the contract value is 10 million VND, Company B has not paid the debt, overdue for 25 months.

- Total overdue receivables of Company B: 30 million VND.

- At the same time, Company A purchased goods from Company B, the amount Company A must pay to Company B is: 10 million VND.

- Thus, the amount remaining to be collected after offsetting the debt payable to Company B is: 20 million VND.

- The provision level for receivables of the shipment under contract 01 is: 5/30 x 20 million VND x 30% = 1 million VND.

- The provision level for receivables of the shipment under contract 02 is: 15/30 x 20 million VND x 50% = 5 million VND.

- The provision level for receivables of the shipment under contract 03 is: 10/30 x 20 million VND x 70% = 4.67 million VND.

4. Financial handling of irrecoverable receivables:

   - Irrecoverable receivables are receivables that are past due or not yet due in one of the following cases:
