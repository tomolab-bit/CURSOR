9. When determining value of closing inventory, the enterprise applies one of following methods:
a) Specific identification method: Specific identification method shall be applied according to actual value of every purchased good or every sold good, so that it is only applied to enterprises having a few items of products or stable and identifiable goods. 
b) Weighted average method: value of every inventory item shall equal mean value of each opening inventory item and value of each inventory item sold or produced in current period. Mean value may be calculated in every period or after import consignment, depending on specific conditions of every enterprise.
c) First in, first out method (FIFO): This method assumes that inventory purchased or manufactured first is sold first and newer inventory purchased or manufactured near the end of the accounting period remains unsold. According to this method, value of inventory sold shall apply prices of purchased inventory at or near the beginning of the accounting period; value of closing inventory shall apply prices of purchased inventory at or near the end of accounting period.
Every inventory costing method has their certain advantages and disadvantages.

Therefore, value of inventory on accounting record may be determined at any time in the accounting period.
At the end of accounting period, the physical inventory count shall be compared with inventory data in ledger. In principle, the actual inventory data must conform to inventory data in ledger. If there is any difference, it is required to uncover reasons and provide solutions. The perpetual inventory system is usually applied to manufacturing enterprise (industry, construction, etc) And commercial enterprises dealing in high value items such as machinery, equipment, engineering goods, high quality , etc.
b) Periodic inventory system:
- The periodic inventory system shall be used to update the ending inventory balance in the general ledger according to the physical inventory count and calculate cost of goods or materials sold following the formulary below:
Cost of goods sold	=	Beginning inventory	+	Purchases	-	Ending inventory
- According to periodic inventory system, any changes in materials or goods (additions to or subtractions from inventory) shall not be recorded to inventory accounts. Value of materials or goods purchased and added to inventory in the period shall be recorded to a separate account (account 611 “Purchases”).
- The physical inventory count and determination of cost of goods or materials sold (for production or for sale) shall be conducted at the end of accounting period and used as the basis for accounting of account 611 “Purchases”. When applying periodic inventory system, inventory accounts shall only used at the beginning of the accounting period (for transfer of opening balance) and at the ending of the accounting period (for recording actual ending inventory).
- This method is usually applied to enterprises trading in multiple types of goods or materials with different specification or models, low value, and those goods or materials are regularly sold for use or sale (retail outlets, etc). This method is simple and easy for accounting. But the accuracy of materials or goods sold is affected by the management of warehouses, depot.

b) Financial lease: a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset to the lessee. Ownership of the asset may be transferred at the end of the lease term.
c) Recognition of financial lease: a financial lease must satisfy at least one of five criteria below:
- Ownership of the asset is transferred to the lessee at the end of the lease term;
- At the inception of the lease, the lessee has an option to purchase the asset at a price which is expected to be sufficiently lower than the value at the end of the lease term;
-  The lease term is for the major part of the economic life of the asset even if title is not transferred;
- At the inception of the lease, the present value of the minimum lease payments amounts to at least substantially all of the fair value of the leased asset;
-  The leased assets are of a specialized nature such that only the lessee can use them without major modifications being made.
d) An asset lease shall be considered a financial lease if it meets at least one of three criteria below:
- If the lessee cancels the lease and compensates the losses caused by the cancellation of the lease to the lessor;

When calculating the present value of minimum lease payments amounts, the enterprise may use the implicit interest rate, interest rate stated in the lease or the incremental borrowing interest rate of the lessee.
e) The non-deductible input VAT on the leased asset which is paid by the lessee on behalf of the lessor shall be recorded as follows:
- If the non-deductible input VAT is made a lump sum payment when recording the leased asset, the historical cost of the leased asset shall include VAT;
- If the non-deductible input VAT is paid instalment, it shall be recorded to operating cost during a period in conformity with depreciation costs of financial lease assets.
g) Operating lease fixed assets shall not be recorded to this account.
h) The lessee shall calculate, depreciate the fixed asset and charge to operating costs periodically in conformity with the depreciation policy applied to its owned-fixed assets in kind.  If it not sure that the lessee shall acquire the ownership of the asset at the end of the lease term, the leased asset shall be depreciated according to the lease term if the lease term is shorter than the useful life of the leased asset.

1. Rules for accounting
a) This account is used to record current value, and increases or decreases of deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax asset 	=	Deductible temporary difference	+	Deductible value transferred to subsequent year of unused taxable losses or preferred taxes	x	Enterprise income tax rate (%)
When recording a deferred tax asset, if the change in enterprise income tax rates in the future has been known and the deferred tax asset is reverted when the new tax rates have been taken effect, the new tax rates shall be applied to the deferred tax assets.
b) Tax basis of an asset or a liability and temporary difference:
- The tax basis of assets is the value deducting from taxable income when recovering the book value of the assets. If the income is not subject to taxes, the tax basis of the asset shall equal book value of such asset. The tax basis of a liability equals (=) its book value minus (-) value to-be deducted from taxable income when the liability is paid in future periods. The tax basis of an unearned revenue shall equal (=) its book value minus (-) value of non-taxable revenue in the future periods.
- Temporary difference equals (=) book value of the asset or liability in the balance sheet minus (-) the tax basis of such asset or liability. Temporary differences include: deductible temporary difference and taxable temporary difference. Deductible temporary difference means an temporary difference arising deductible amounts when determining taxable income in future when the book value of asset items are recovered or liabilities are paid.
+ Temporary difference in time is a type of temporary difference, for example: if the book profits recorded in this accounting period but the taxable income is recorded in another accounting period.
+ A temporary difference between book value of an asset or a liability and the tax basis of such asset or liability cannot be a temporary difference in time, for example: When an asset is re-evaluated, the book value of that asset changes but its tax basis does not change, a temporary difference shall arise. However, the recovering time of the book value and the tax basis does not change, so that such temporary difference is not a temporary difference in time.
+ Because the time in which the asset or the liability must be recovered or such asset or liability is offset against taxable income is limited, when determining deferred tax, the term “Permanent difference” shall not be used to distinguish temporary difference.
c) If the enterprise estimates that it is definite to earn taxable future profits to use the deductible temporary difference, taxable losses and unused preferential tariff treatment, deferred tax assets shall be recorded relating to:
- Deductible temporary differences (other than temporary difference arising from initial recognition of the asset or liability paid for a transaction other than business combination transactions; and do not affect to accounting profits and taxable income (or taxable losses) at the transaction time).
- The remaining taxable losses and unused preferential tariff treatment after deduction shall be transferred to subsequent year.
d) At year-end, the enterprise must prepare “Statement of deductible temporary difference determination”, “Statement of deductible unused temporary difference observation”, the deductible value transferred to subsequent year of unused taxable losses and preferred taxes shall be the basis to prepare “Statement of deferred tax asset determination”, to determine value of deferred tax assets recognized or reverted during a year.
dd) The recognition of deferred tax asset in a year shall be carried out by offsetting deferred income tax assets arisen this year against business income tax assets recognized in previous years, but they are reverted in this year according to the following rules:
- If the deferred tax assets arisen during a year are greater than deferred tax assets reverted during the year, the difference between them shall be recognized as deferred tax assets and a decrease in deferred tax expenses shall be recorded.
- If the deferred tax assets arisen during a year are smaller than deferred tax assets reverted during the year, the difference between them shall be recognized as a decrease in deferred tax assets and an increase in deferred tax expenses shall be recorded.
e) When the taxable losses or preferential tariff treatment are used and deductible temporary difference no longer have influence on taxable profits (when assets are recovered or liabilities are paid partly or totally), the deferred tax assets must be reverted.
g) When preparing financial statements, if the enterprise estimates that it is definite to earn taxable future profits, the deferred tax assets not recognized in the previous years shall be recorded to a decrease in deferred tax expense.
h) The offsetting between deferred tax assets and deferred tax payables shall be carried out only if the balance sheet is prepared, not when the deferred tax assets are recorded on the accounting records.

Article 59. Account 343 - Bonds released
1. Accounting Principles
Account 343 is only applied to enterprises borrowing capital by the mode of releasing bond. This account is used to record situation of releasing bond, including convertible bond and payment situation for bond of enterprises. This account is also used for recording bonds discounts, premium when issuing bond, and allocation situation of discounts, premiums when determining borrowing costs charged to business and production costs or capitalized for every period.
Real interest rate (also called effective interest rate) is defined as follows:
It is interest rates for loans of commercial banks commonly applied in the market at the time of the transaction;
b) Where the interest rate cannot be determined in accordance with point a above, the real interest rate is the interest rate that enterprises may borrow under the form of issued debt instruments which must not be convertible into shares (bond issuance must not commonly converted or borrowed by conventional contract) in conditions of production, business which is going on normally.
Principles of common bonds (unconvertible bonds)
When enterprises borrow capital by releasing bond, three cases may occur:
- Releasing bond at par (released price equal to Bond par value): means releasing bond with the price complied with bond par value. This case often occurs when the market interest rate is equal to the nominal interest rate of bond released;
- Releasing bond at discount (released price less than Bond par value): means releasing bond with the price lower than bond par value, called discounts of bond. This case often occurs when market interest rate is higher than nominal interest rate of bond released;
- Releasing bond at premium (released price higher than Bond par value): means releasing bond with the price higher than bond par value. The difference between released Bond par values higher than price of bond called premium of bond. This case often occurs when market interest rate is lower than nominal interest rate of bond released; 
b) Bond discount and premium are only incurred when enterprises borrow by the mode of releasing bond, and at the releasing time, there is a difference between market interest rate and nominal interest rate approved by the investors who buy bond. Bond discount and premium are determined and recorded immediately at the time of releasing bond. The difference between market interest rate and nominal interest rate after the time of leasing bond shall not influence on value of premiums or discounts recorded.
c) Enterprises using Account 3431 - Bonds often used to record the details of contents related to the bond released, including:
- Bond par value;
- Bond discount;
- Bond premium 
Also monitor in detail according to issuance duration of bond.
d) Enterprises must monitor discounts and premiums for every type of bond released, and allocation situation of every discount and premium when determining borrowing costs charged to business and production costs or capitalized for every period, namely:
- Bond discount is allocated gradually to be charged into borrowing costs for every period during bond life;
- Bond premium is allocated gradually to reduce borrowing costs for every period during the bond life; 
- In case of bonds’ interest costs are qualified for capitalization, borrowing interests and the allocation of discounts or premiums capitalized in every period must not exceed actual borrowing interests incurred and the allocation of discounts or premiums in that period;
- The allocation of discounts or premiums may use the actual interest rate method or the straight line method:
According to the real interest rate method: Discounts or premiums allocated into each term calculated by the difference between borrowing interest costs payable for every term of interest payment (calculated by beginning book value of bond multiply (x) with rate of actual interest in the market) with amounts payable every term.
According to the straight line method: Discounts or premiums allocated equally during bond life.
e) In case of paying interest at maturity, periodically, enterprises must calculate bond interest’s payable every term, to record it into business and production costs or capitalize it into value of unfinished assets
g) When making financial statement, in the liabilities of the balance sheet, the item of bond released shall be recorded on net basis (determining by bond value at par minus (-) bond discount are plus (+) Bond premium)
h) Cost of issuing bonds is gradually allocated in accordance with bond life under the straight line method or real interest rate method and recorded in the financial expense or capitalized. At the time of initial record, the cost of issuing bonds is recorded a decrease in par value of the bond. Periodically, accountants allocate cost for bond issuance by recording an increase in the par value and recording in financial expense or capitalization in accordance with the recording accrued interest of the bond.
Accounting principles of convertible bonds
Convertible bonds are bonds that may be converted into common shares of the same issuer under the conditions identified in the released plan. Enterprises issuing convertible bonds must carry out procedures and meet the conditions of the convertible bonds issuance under the provisions of law.
b) Enterprise (the issuer of convertible bonds) uses account 3432 - Convertible bonds to record the value of the principal of convertible bonds at the time of reporting. Enterprises must open detailed accounting books to keep track of each type of convertible bonds according to term, interest rate and par value.
c) Convertible bonds recorded on account 3432 are bonds that can be converted into a number of determined shares defined in the issuance plan. Bonds that may be converted into a number of undetermined shares at maturity (depending on the market value of the shares at maturity) are accounted for as common bonds.
d) Cost of issuing convertible bonds is gradually allocated in accordance with bond life under the straight line method or real interest rate method and recorded in the financial expense or capitalized. At the time of initial record, the cost of issuing convertible bonds is recorded reducing par value of the bond. Periodically, accountings allocate cost for bond issuance by recording increasing the par value recorded in financial expense or capitalized in accordance with the recording accrued interest of the bond.
e) At the time of initial record, when issuing convertible bonds, enterprises must calculate and determine separately value of the debt component (principal debt) and capital component of convertible bonds. Principal debt of convertible bonds is recorded a liabilities; component of capital (stock options) of convertible bonds is recorded an equity. The valuation of the components of the convertible bond is carried out as follows:
- Valuation of the principal of convertible bonds at the time of release
At the time of initial record, the value of the principal of convertible bonds is determined by discounting the nominal value of future payments (including principal and interest of bonds) about the present value under interest rate of similar bonds in the market without the right to convert into shares and subtracting the cost of issuing convertible bonds. In case of failure to determine the interest rate of similar bonds, enterprises use common loan interest rates in the market at the time of the issuance of bonds to determine the present value of future payments.
Common loan interest rate in the market is loan interest rate used in the majority of transactions in the market.
 Enterprises shall actively determine common loan interest rates in the market in the most accordance with characteristics of the production and trading of the enterprises in consistence with the provisions of the State Bank.
Example of valuation of the principal of convertible bonds at the time of release: On January 1, 2012, Thang Long joint-stock company issues 1 million of convertible bonds with par value of VND 10,000 in 3-year period, nominal interest rate is 10% / year, payment of interest is every year at the end of the year. Interest rate of unconvertible similar bonds is 15% / year. At maturity, each bond is convertible into one share. Knowing that the convertible bonds are issued to mobilize capital for normal production, business (interest is included in financial expense). Valuation of the principal of convertible bonds at the time of initial record is carried out (ignoring the cost of issuing bonds) as follows:
Unit: dong
 	 nominal value of future liabilities	 	discount rate	 	Present value of future liabilities
First year:	1,000,000,000
 
(accrued interest)	x
 	[1/1.15]	=	869,565,000
Second year:	1,000,000,000
 
(accrued interest)	x	[1/1.15^2]	=	756.144.000
Third year:	1,000,000,000
 
 (accrued interest)	x	[1/1.15^3]	=	657,516,000
Third year:	10,000,000,000
(accrued principal)	x	[1/1.15^3]	=	6,575,160,000
Total 	 	 	 	 	8,858,385,000
According to this example, total amount collected from the bond issuance is 10,000,000,000d, in which the total present value of future payments including principal and interest of bonds is 8,858,385,000d. This value is defined as the value of the principal of convertible bonds at the time of initial recording and is recorded as liabilities from the issuance of convertible bonds.
- Valuation of capital component of convertible bonds (bond conversion option)
The value of the capital component of convertible bonds is defined as the difference between the total amounts collected from issuance of convertible bonds and the value of the debt component of the convertible bond at the time of release.
According to the above example, the value of the capital component of convertible bonds is defined as: 10,000,000,000 - 8,858,385,000 = 1,141,615 billion dong. The value of capital component of convertible bonds is recorded as stock options under the equity.
g) After initial recording, accountants must adjust the value of the principal of converted bond as follows:
- Record an increase in the value of the principal of the bonds for issuance costs allocated periodically;
- Record an increase in the value of the principal of bonds for the difference between the payable bond interests calculated on the interest of the unconvertible similar bond or real interest rates higher than the payable interest calculated on nominal interest rate.
Example: Following the above example, the determination of financial expenses in the period and adjustment of the value of the principal of convertible bonds at the end of the period shall be as follows:
Unit Thousand dong
 	Value of the principal of convertible bonds at the beginning of period	Financial expense recorded in the period
(Interest 15%/year)	Accrued interest calculated on the nominal interest rate of 10% / year	Value adjusted to increase the principal of convertible bonds during the period	Value of the principal of convertible bonds at the end of period
First year:	8,858,385	1,328,760
[8,858,385 x 15%]	1,000,000	328,760	9,187,150
Second year:	9,187,150	1,378,070
[9,187,150 x 15%]	1,000,000	378,070	9,565,220
Third year:	9,565,220	1,434,780
[9,565,220 x 15%]	1,000,000	434,780	10,000,000
h) Upon maturity of convertible bonds:
- The value of stock options of convertible bonds recorded in equity is transferred to be recorded as premium of share capital which does not depend on the bondholders who can exercise the option to convert into stock or not.
- If the bondholders do not exercise the option to convert bonds into stocks, enterprises must record a decrease in the principal of convertible bonds in proportion to the repaid amount of the bond.
- If the bondholders exercise the option to convert bonds into stocks, accountants must record a decrease in the principal of convertible bonds and record an increase in owner’s capital in proportion to par value of stocks released additionally. The difference between the values of the principal of the convertible bonds which is higher than the value of stocks released additionally is recorded as share premium.

Deferred income tax payable is determined on the basic of taxable temporary difference amounts tax incurred in year and tax rate of current income tax according to following formula:

Basis of charging tax of income of liabilities is its recording value which minuses (-) value which shall be deducted from taxable income upon payments of liabilities in future periods. For income received in advance, basis of assessment is its recording value, which minuses the value of non-taxable income in future.
- Temporary differences are the differences between the recording value of assets or liabilities in the Balance Sheet and the basis of charging tax of such assets or liabilities. Temporary differences include two categories: deductible temporary differences and taxable temporary differences. Taxable temporary differences are temporary differences arising income tax payable upon determination of taxable income in the future when the recording value of the assets are recovered or liabilities are paid.

Temporary differences between book value of assets or liabilities compared to basis of charging tax of such assets or liabilities may not be temporary differences in term of time, for example: When revaluing assets, the book value of the property changes, but if the basis of charging tax does not change, the temporary difference shall arise. However, recovery time of book value and basis of charging tax shall not change; the temporary differences shall not be temporary differences in term of time.

- If deferred income taxes payable incurred in year are less than deferred income taxes refunded in year, accountants only record a decrease (refund) of deferred income taxes being the difference between deferred income taxes payable incurred and deferred income taxes refunded in year;

Article 78. Accounting Principles for turnovers
1. Turnovers from the economic benefits gained increase equity of enterprises except for the additional contribution of the shareholders. Turnovers is recorded at the time the transaction arises when the economic benefits are firmly gained, determined under the fair value of sum entitled to be received, regardless of having earned money or being going to earn money.
2. Turnovers and cost setting up such turnovers must be recorded simultaneously under the principle of conformity. However, in some cases, conformity principles may conflict with the precautionary principle in accounting, accountants must base on the nature and accounting standards to record transactions honestly and reasonably.
- An economic contract may include multiple transactions. Accountants must identify transactions to apply conditions to record turnovers in accordance with the provisions of accounting Standards of "Turnovers".
- Turnovers must be recorded in accordance with nature rather than the form or the name of the transaction and must be allocated under obligations of providing goods or services.
For example, customers may only receive promotional goods when buying goods of units (buying two products, getting one free), the nature of the transaction is discount, free gift products in the form are known as promotion but in nature are sale because customers will not qualify  if they do not buy the product. In this case, the value of free gift products is recorded in cost price and turnovers corresponding to the fair value of such products must be recorded.
Example: In case of selling products and goods with replacement products, goods, equipment (in case of malfunction prevention), turnovers for shall products, goods sold and replacement products, goods, equipment must be allocated. The value of the replacement products, goods, equipment is recorded in cost of goods sold.
- For transactions from which obligations of the seller arising at the current time and in the future, turnovers must be allocated according to the fair value of each obligation and are recorded when the obligations are fulfilled .
3. Turnovers, profit or loss are only considered not to be earned if enterprises must be responsible for obligations in the future (except for normal warranty obligation) and are uncertain of economic benefit; The classification of gains and losses into earned or unearned does not depend on the cash flow is incurred or not.
Gains and losses arising from revaluation of assets and liabilities are not considered not to be earned because at the time of revaluation, units have the right to the property and has obligation with liabilities, for example: Gains and losses arising from revaluation of assets contributed as capital investment in other units, revaluation of financial assets at fair value, exchange differences  due to revaluation of monetary items derived from foreign currencies ... are considered to have earned.
4. Turnovers do not include sums collected on third party, for example:
- Indirect taxes (VAT, export duties, excise taxes, environmental protection tax) payable;
- Amount which the turnovers agent collects on goods owners due to turnovers agency ;
- Surcharges and fees collected in addition to the unit price are not entitled;
- Other cases.
In case of indirect taxes payable that are not separated immediately at the time transactions are incurred, to facilitate accountants, turnovers in the accounting books including indirect taxes may be recorded but periodically, accountants must record a decrease for indirect taxes payable. However, when preparing financial statements, accountants are required to identify and remove all of the indirect taxes payable out of standards of recording turnovers payable. 
5. Time, basis for recording accounting turnovers and taxable turnovers may vary depending on the specific situation. The taxable turnovers are only used to determine tax payable as prescribed by law; Turnovers recorded in the accounting books for the financial statements must comply with the accounting principles and, depending on cases, are not necessarily equal to the amount stated on the bill of sale.
6. When rotating products, goods and services among dependent cost-accounting units within the enterprises, depending on the operating characteristics, decentralization of each unit, enterprises may decide on recording turnovers in the units if there is an increase in the value of products and goods between the stages that do not depend on any accompanying documents (invoices or internal vouchers). When preparing general financial statements, all turnovers among units within the enterprises must be excluded.
7. Turnovers recorded shall only include turnovers of the reporting period. For accounts that record turnovers without balance, at the end of period, accountants must transfer turnovers to determine income statement.

Principle for recording and determination of turnovers from construction contracts
Turnovers from construction contracts include:
- The original turnovers written in contract;
- Amounts increased, decreased when implementing the contract, bonus and other payments, if these items may change turnovers, and can be determined reliably:
Turnovers from contract can increase or decrease in each period, for example: Contractors and consumers can agree upon changes and requirements, that increase or decrease turnovers of contract in the next period, in compassion with originally accepted contract. Turnovers agreed in the contract is based on fixed prices, so it can increase because of price increase. Turnovers written in contract can decrease because the contractor did not meet schedules of activities, or did not guarantee construction agreed in the contract. In case the contract written with fixed prices, that regulate a fixed price level for a finished unit of product, then turnovers calculated in contract will increase or decrease when product volume increases or decreases. 
Bonuses are extras paid for contractors if they perform fairly or well contract requirements. Bonuses are charged to contract revenues if having both two conditions.
 (i) Bonuses are determined reliably.                                              
 (ii) Bonuses are determined reliably
- Another payment that contractor receives from customer or another party to compensate for expenses not included in contract prices. For example, delays caused by customers; errors in technical or design indicators, and disputes on changes in carrying out the contract. Determination of turnover increase from these payments also depend on many uncertain factors, and usually depend on results of many negotiations. Thus, other payments are charged to turnover only if:
Negotiation obtained the solution that the customer accept to compensate;
Other payments are accepted by customers and can be determined reliably.
b) Recording turnovers of construction contract will comply with one of two conditions:
- In case the construction contract defines that the contractor shall be entitled to payment basing on the progress, when achieved results of construction contract are estimated reliably, then turnover from the construction contract is recorded proportionally to part of works finished, determined by contractors on the date of financial statement without depending on the bills under the progress made or not and the amount on the bills.
- In case the construction contract defines that the contractor shall be entitled to payment basing on value of volume achieved, when achieved results of construction contract are estimated reliably and confirmed by customers, then revenues and expenditures related to the contract recorded in proportion to the completed work confirmed by the customer in period are recorded in the bills set up.
c) In case achieved results of construction contract can’t be estimated reliably, then:
- Turnover is only recorded proportionally to with incurred costs of contract that the repayment is relatively certain.
- Costs of contract is only recorded a period costs when these costs had been incurred.
In case of assets lease, lessors received rent in advance for many periods, then recording turnovers shall be made under the principle of allocating the rent received in advance in accordance with the lease period. 
Where the rental period is 90% of the useful life of the assets, enterprises may choose method of recording turnovers once for the entire rental amount received in advance if the following conditions are met simultaneously:
The lessee is not entitled to cancel the lease contract and the lessor has no obligation to repay the amount received in advance in all cases and in all forms;
The amount received in advance from the lease is not less than 90% of the total lease amount expected to get under the contract during the lease term and the lessee must pay the entire amount of lease within 12 months from the beginning of the lease;
Almost all the risks and benefits associated with ownership of the leased asset are transferred to the lessee;
The lessor must estimate relatively the full cost of the lease.
Enterprises recorded turnover in the total amount received in advance in this case shall be explain in the financial statements on :
The difference in turnovers and profits, if being recorded in the method of gradual allocation under lease time;
The effect of recording turnovers in the period on the ability to create money, risks of declining turnover, profits of future periods.
In case enterprises perform the tasks of supplying products, goods, services as required by government, and are subsidized, price supported as regulated by government, then the subsidized or price supported turnovers are amounts officially announced, or actually subsidized or price supported.
In case of sale of products and goods with replacement products, goods, equipment (prevention in case products, goods malfunction) turnovers must be allocated for products, goods sold and goods, equipment must be delivered to the customer to replace and prevent damage.  The value of the replacement products, goods, equipment is recorded in cost of sales.

- For enterprises assigned to manage construction, investment projects using state budget funds or Government bonds, municipal bonds, in case of making estimate of administrative expense of projects under the provisions of the State on investment and construction using state budget funds,  the funds for the project manager reimbursed by the state budget are not accounted for as turnover but recorded a decrease in administrative expense of projects.

1. Accounting Principles

- Interests: interests on loans, interests on cash in banks, on credit sales, installment sales, earnings from investment bond, notes, discounts earned from purchasing goods, services

In case of buying or selling securities under the form of share swap (investors swap share A for share B), accountants determine the value of shares received under the fair value at the date of exchange as follows:
- For shares received being the listed shares, the fair value of the shares is the closing price listed on securities market at the date of exchange. If at the date of exchange, securities market does not work, the fair value of the shares is the closing price of the previous session preceding the date of exchange.
- For shares received being the unlisted shares traded on UPCOM, the fair value of the shares is the closing price announced on UPCOM at the date of exchange. If at the date of exchange, UPCOM does not work, the fair value of the shares is the closing price of the previous session preceding the date of exchange.
- For shares received being other unlisted shares, the fair value of the shares is the agreed price by the parties or the book value at the time of exchange or book value at the end of the previous quarter preceding the exchange date. The determination of the book value of the shares is carried out according to the formula:
The book value of shares	=	Total equity 
		Number of available shares at the time of exchange
c) For revenues from buying and selling foreign currency, revenue is recorded as the interest difference between the price of exchange rate sold and the price of foreign bought.
d) For deposit interest: Revenue does not include interest of deposit arising from the temporary investment of loans used for unfinished asset construction purposes as prescribed by accounting Standard on borrowing costs .
dd) For interest received from loans, credit or installment sale: Revenue is only recorded when it is definitely earned and original loans, principals receivables are not classified as overdue that need provision.
e) For gains on investments received from investments in stocks, bonds, then only part of interest in the periods which business use to redeem these investments shall be recorded a revenue incurred in the period, and gains on investments from accrued investment before enterprises buy such investment are recorded a cost price of such bonds and stocks investments.
g) For distributed dividends, profit used to revaluate investments when determining the value of the enterprise for equitization: When determining the value of the enterprise for equitization, if the financial investments are evaluated as increase in proportion to ownership of equitized enterprises in undistributed post-tax profits of invested party, equitized enterprises must record an increase in state capital as prescribed by the law. Then, upon receipt of dividends, profits used to evaluate the increase of state capital, equitized enterprises do not record revenue from financial activities but record a decrease in the value of financial investments.
h) When investors receive dividends in shares, investors only monitor the number of shares increased in the note of financial statements, do not record the value of shares received, do not record revenue from financial activities, do not record an increase in the value of the investment into company.
For enterprises of which 100% charter capital is held by the State, accounting for dividends received by shares shall be complied with the provisions of law on the types of enterprises owned by the State (if any).

Article 81. Account 521 -  Revenue deductions
1. Accounting Principles
a) This account is used to record the deducted adjusted amounts in revenue from sales and service provisions incurred in the period, including: trade discounts, sales returns and allowances. This account does not record the taxes deducted in revenue such as output VAT payable under subtraction method.
b) The decrease adjustment of revenue shall be as follows:
- Trade discounts, sales returns and allowances incurred in the same period of consumption of products, goods and services are adjusted a decrease in revenue in the incurring period ;
- In case products, goods and services are sold from the previous periods, until the next period are incurred trade discounts, sales returns and allowances, enterprises record a decrease in revenue under the principles:
If the products, goods or services are sold from the previous period, until the next period must be discounted, discounted to trade, returned but are incurred prior to the issuance of financial statements, accountants consider this as an adjustment event occurring after the date of balance sheet and record a decrease in revenue, on the financial statements of the reporting period (the previous period).
In case products, goods and services must be discounted to trade, returned after the release of financial statements, enterprises record a decrease in revenue of incurring period (the next period).
c) Trade discount payable means enterprises sell goods with price lower than the listed price with a large volume. The seller performs accounting for trade discount according to the following principles:
- In case the VAT invoice or bill of sale shows trade discounts to buyers that are the deduction from the amount payable by the buyer (the selling price recorded in the invoice is the price deducted trade discount), enterprises (sellers) do not use this account, revenue from sales price is recorded according to the price deducted trade discount (net revenue).
- Accountants must monitor separately the trade discounts that enterprises pay to the buyer but have not yet been recorded as the deduction from the amount payable on the bill. In this case, the seller records the initial revenue at cost excluding trade discount (gross revenue). Trade discounts that must be monitored separately on this account often arise in cases :
The trade discount that buyers enjoy is higher than the amount of sales recorded in invoice at the last time. This case may arise because buyers must buy goods many times to be entitled to discounted goods volume and the trade discounts shall only be determined in the final purchase;
Manufacturers at the end of period may determine the goods volume consumed by distributors (such as supermarkets) which is a basis to determine the trade discounts payable on sales or the number of products sold.
d) Sales allowance is the deduction to the buyer because products, goods are bad, degraded or improper as prescribed in economic contracts. The seller performs accounting for sale allowance according to the following principles:
- In case the VAT invoice or bill of sale shows sales allowances to buyers that are the deduction from the amount payable by the buyer (the selling price recorded in the invoice is the discounted price), enterprises (sellers) do not use this account, revenue from sales is recorded according to the discounted price (net revenue).
- Only deductions due to approval of discount after sales( recorded revenue) and issuing invoices (discounts outside invoice) due to bad and degraded goods are recorded in this account...

d) Account 627 is recorded by detailed accounting for every factory, department, team and group of production
dd) manufacturing overhead costs recorded on account 627 must be accounted for in detail under two categories: Fixed overhead and variable overhead, in which:
- Fixed manufacturing overhead expenses are indirect production costs, usually do not depend on volume of products, such as costs of maintenance machinery and equipment, plants..., and General administration expenses in factories, departments, production teams and groups.
Fixed manufacturing overhead expenses are allocated in manufacturing costs of each unit of production, it is based on normal capacity of machinery normal capacity is volume of products achieved averagely in normal conditions of production.
In case actual volume of products is higher than that of normal capacity, then fixed overhead will be allocated for each unit of product with actual costs incurred.
In case actual volume of products is lower than that of normal capacity, then fixed overhead will be allocated to manufacturing costs for each unit of product in normal capacity. Unallocated part of costs will be recorded in cost of goods sold in the period. 
- Variable manufacturing overhead cost is indirect production costs usually directly or almost directly volume of product units, such as costs of raw materials, indirect materials, indirect labor costs. Variable manufacturing overhead are allocated to tally to manufacturing costs of each product unit according to actually incurred costs.
e) In case a production process induce many types of costs during the same period, and manufacturing overhead cost of each type of product can’t be recorded separately, then overhead will be allocated to these types of costs under grouping characteristics appropriately and consistently among account periods.
