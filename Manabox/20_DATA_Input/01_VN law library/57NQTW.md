RESOLUTION
OF THE POLITICAL BUREAU
ON BREAKTHROUGHS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, INNOVATION, AND NATIONAL DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION
The development of science, technology, innovation, and digital transformation is now the decisive factor in the progress of nations. It represents the key prerequisite and the greatest opportunity for our country to achieve prosperity and strength in this new era - the era of national advancement.
In recent years, our Party and State have introduced numerous policies to promote the application and development of science and technology, encourage innovation, and advance digital transformation. We have actively engaged in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, yielding significant achievements. However, the pace and scale of breakthroughs in science, technology, innovation, and national digital transformation remain slow. Our national scientific, technological, and innovation capabilities still lag considerably behind those of developed countries. Awareness among many sectors, levels of government, officials, civil servants, and the public regarding digital transformation remains insufficient and superficial. Research, application, and innovation in science and technology have yet to achieve decisive breakthroughs or establish mastery over strategic and core technologies. The legal framework, mechanisms, and policies are still inadequate. The legal framework, mechanisms, and policies are still inadequate. The availability of high-quality human resources is insufficient. Infrastructure, particularly digital infrastructure, remains incomplete, and there are considerable challenges in ensuring information security, cybersecurity, and data protection.
Our country now faces an urgent need for bold, strategic, and revolutionary decisions to generate new momentum and breakthroughs in the development of science, technology, innovation, and digital transformation. This is essential to propel the nation forward in this new era - an era of prosperity and strength - ensuring the successful realization of the national goals: by 2030, Vietnam aims to become a developing country with modern industry and upper-middle income; by 2045, it aspires to become a high-income developed nation. Given this context, the Political Bureau requires the effective implementation of the following directives:
I- GUIDING PRINCIPLES
1. The development of science, technology, innovation, and national digital transformation is the foremost critical breakthrough and the primary driving force for the rapid advancement of modern productive forces, the completion of production relations, the transformation of national governance methods, economic and social development, the prevention of stagnation risks, and the nation’s breakthrough growth towards prosperity in the new era.
2. Strengthening the Party's comprehensive leadership and mobilizing the collective strength of the entire political system, businesses, entrepreneurs, and the people in advancing science, technology, innovation, and national digital transformation. This is a profound and comprehensive revolution across all sectors, requiring determined, consistent, synchronized, and long-term implementation through breakthrough, revolutionary solutions. People and businesses are at the center, as key stakeholders, resources, and driving forces; scientists are pivotal contributors; and the State plays a leading role in facilitating and promoting the most favorable conditions for the development of science, technology, innovation, and digital transformation.
3. Institutions, human resources, infrastructure, data, and strategic technologies are the core focus areas, with institutions serving as the prerequisite, requiring completion and advancement ahead of other aspects. Legislative reforms must balance regulatory oversight with innovation encouragement, eliminating the mindset of "prohibit what cannot be managed."  Priority should be given to ensuring high-quality human resources for science, technology, innovation, and digital transformation, with special mechanisms and policies for talent development. Infrastructure development, particularly digital and technological infrastructure, should adhere to the principles of “modernity, synchronization, security, safety, efficiency, and waste prevention”. Maximizing the potential of data is crucial - transforming data into a key production resource, accelerating the development of big data, data industries, and the digital economy.
4. Rapid yet sustainable development, with a step-by-step approach to technological self-sufficiency, especially in strategic technologies. National resources should be prioritized for science, technology, innovation, and digital transformation. Vietnam must maximize its intellectual potential while quickly absorbing, mastering, and applying advanced global scientific and technological achievements. The country should accelerate applied research, prioritize fundamental research, and move toward technological self-reliance and competitive advantage in key areas where Vietnam has needs, potential, and advantages.
5. Safeguarding national sovereignty in cyberspace, ensuring cybersecurity, data security, and information safety for organizations and individuals - this is a consistent, inseparable requirement throughout the development of science, technology, innovation, and national digital transformation.
