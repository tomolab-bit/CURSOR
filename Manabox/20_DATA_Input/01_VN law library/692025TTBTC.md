In case a foreign contractor signs a contract with suppliers in Vietnam to purchase raw materials, machinery, equipment to perform the contractor contract and goods and services for internal consumption, consumption of items not included in the items and work that the foreign contractor performs under the contractor contract, the value of these goods and services shall not be deducted when determining the foreign contractor's VAT-liable revenue.

In case the contractor's contract does not separate the value of each business activity, the percentage rate to calculate value added tax on revenue is 3% calculated on the entire contract value (including the value of imported raw materials or machinery and equipment). In case a foreign contractor signs a contract with subcontractors to hand over all parts of the value of work or items including materials or machinery and equipment, and the foreign contractor only performs the remaining service value according to the contractor contract, the % rate for calculating value added tax is applied to the service industry (5%).

   - For contracts for the supply of machinery and equipment with accompanying services performed in Vietnam, if the value of machinery and equipment and the value of services can be separated when determining the amount of VAT payable, the percentage rate to calculate VAT on the revenue of each part of the contract value shall be applied. In case the value of machinery and equipment and the value of services cannot be separated in the contract, the percentage rate to calculate VAT on taxable revenue shall be 3%.
