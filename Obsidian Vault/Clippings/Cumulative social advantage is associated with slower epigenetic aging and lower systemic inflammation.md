## 1\. Introduction

Social relationships are robust determinants of health, functional capacity, and longevity, with strong and supportive networks linked to lower risks of morbidity and mortality, enhanced immune function, and improved cognitive outcomes (; ). Yet access to these relational resources is unevenly distributed, and advantages tend to accumulate over time, contributing to widening health disparities across the life course (; ). Cumulative advantage theory offers a framework for understanding these disparities, proposing that social resources cluster and compound over time and are associated with increasingly divergent trajectories of health and aging (; ).

Building on this framework, we conceptualize cumulative social advantage (CSA) as a multidimensional construct reflecting sustained access to social resources across four domains: family relationships, religious involvement, emotional support, and community engagement. Prior research has often examined individual social indicators—such as marital status or network size—in isolation (; ). By contrast, CSA captures the breadth, persistence, and co-occurrence of social connection across multiple contexts. This construct has been empirically validated and linked to lower multimorbidity, better functional health, and reduced mortality risk (). Here, we extend this work by testing whether CSA is associated with biological aging, conceptualized as the progressive decline in molecular and physiological systems integrity. Drawing on the concept of biological embedding (), we hypothesize that sustained social advantage becomes reflected in core regulatory systems linked to aging, including epigenetic, inflammatory, and neuroendocrine pathways.

Epigenetic aging, measured by DNA methylation clocks such as GrimAge and DunedinPACE, captures cumulative molecular changes predictive of morbidity and mortality, and is sensitive to social adversity and relationship quality (; ; ; ). Chronic low-grade inflammation (“inflammaging”), indexed by circulating cytokines and adhesion molecules such as IL-6 and TNF-α, contributes to cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurodegenerative disease and is shaped by social-environmental exposures (). Neuroendocrine function, assessed via overnight urinary concentrations of cortisol, cortisone, and catecholamines, reflects integrated hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal and sympathetic–adrenomedullary activity—systems highly responsive to psychosocial contexts (; ).

Our conceptual model integrates life course theory (), which emphasizes the cumulative accrual of relational resources; the weathering hypothesis (; ), which describes how these accumulated resources are reflected in biological markers through differential wear and tear on stress-responsive systems; and the stress-buffering model (; ), which posits that social resources attenuate physiological stress responses. Together, these perspectives predict that CSA should relate most strongly to biomarkers reflecting cumulative biological burden—such as DNA methylation–based aging indices and chronic inflammatory markers—rather than short-term activation markers (e.g., urinary catecholamines, cortisol). Using data from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study, a large national cohort with extensive psychosocial and biomarker data, we model CSA as a higher-order latent factor derived from 16 validated indicators, testing its associations with epigenetic aging, systemic inflammation, and neuroendocrine function.

## 2\. Methods

### 2.1. Transparency and openness

This study used publicly available data from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) project. All survey instruments, codebooks, and documentation are accessible via the MIDUS Colectica Portal ([https://midus.colectica.org/](https://midus.colectica.org/)). Analytic code is available from the corresponding author upon request. This work adheres to Level 2 of the American Psychological Association's Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) Guidelines.

### 2.2. Participants and procedures

### 2.3. Measures

Religious and faith-based support was measured using three scales: religious identification (e.g., “How important is religion in your life?”), religious practice (e.g., “How often do you read the Bible or other religious literature”), and religious coping (e.g., “When you have problems or difficulties in your family, work, or personal life, how often do you seek comfort through religious or spiritual means such as praying, meditating, attending a religious or spiritual service, or talking to a religious or spiritual advisor?”). Parent-child relationship quality included four retrospective assessments: maternal warmth (e.g., “How much affection did she give you?”), maternal generosity (e.g., “How generous and helpful was she to people outside the family?”), paternal warmth (e.g., “How much time and attention did he give you when you needed it?”), and paternal generosity (e.g., “How sociable and friendly was he to people outside the family?”).

Community engagement was assessed using six scales reflecting both attitudinal and relational dimensions: social integration (e.g., “I feel close to other people in my community”), social actualization (e.g., “The world is becoming a better place for everyone”), social contribution (e.g., “I have something valuable to give to the world”), social acceptance (e.g., “I believe that people are kind”), friendship support (e.g., “How much can you open up to them if you need to talk about your worries?”), and positive relations with others (e.g., “I enjoy personal and mutual conversations with family members and friends”). Finally, extended emotional support was indexed by the number of hours per month participants reported receiving emotional support from parents, children, and other kin or friends. These responses were categorized into eight ordinal bins to minimize the potential leverage of large values and help normalize distributional skew.

In prior work, the CSA construct was conceptualized as a higher-order latent factor capturing the life-course accumulation of social connection and relational resources, indicated by two temporally anchored domains: (a) retrospective indicators of early parental relationship quality that shape social competencies and internal working models, and (b) contemporary indicators of adult relational embeddedness and resources ().. This specification is theoretically grounded in cumulative advantage () and life-course perspectives on linked lives and developmental scaffolding ) and aligns with attachment-based evidence that early caregiving organizes the acquisition and maintenance of adult relationships (; ). Modeling childhood and adult indicators within a single latent construct, thus, permits estimation of the combined influence of past and present embeddedness on profiles of biological aging.

**Epigenetic Aging Clocks**. Biological aging was assessed using whole-blood DNA methylation data processed through a panel of seven validated epigenetic clocks. These algorithms estimate either chronological age or the rate of physiological aging by modeling methylation levels at specific cytosine–phosphate–guanine (CpG) sites.

The Horvath clock () is a widely used cross-tissue predictor based on 353 CpGs and was trained to estimate chronological age across multiple cell types. Horvath2 () updates this model using 391 CpGs optimized for blood and skin-derived samples, improving precision in those tissues. The Hannum clock (Hannum et al., 2013) is specific to whole-blood methylation and includes 71 CpGs selected from adult cohorts.

To evaluate aging phenotypes more directly linked to morbidity risk, we included three health-optimized clocks. PhenoAge () is derived from 513 CpGs weighted against a composite of clinical biomarkers (e.g., glucose, albumin, C-reactive protein) predictive of mortality and chronic disease. GrimAge (, ) incorporates DNA methylation-based surrogates for plasma proteins and cumulative smoking exposure to estimate time-to-death. Three versions were used: the original GrimAge, a re-implementation using the GrimAge2 framework, and an extended variant incorporating methylation-based proxies for C-reactive protein and glycated hemoglobin. These clocks have demonstrated high prognostic value and are increasingly employed to investigate the biological embedding of social and environmental conditions. Finally, DunedinPACE () was included as a dynamic measure of biological aging rate. Unlike the other clocks, DunedinPACE estimates the *pace* of physiological decline by leveraging longitudinal methylation change, providing a temporal index of aging trajectory rather than a static age estimate.

**Serum-Based Markers of Inflammation**. Systemic inflammation was assessed using eight serum biomarkers indexing key components of immune activation, including cytokine signaling, endothelial function, and acute-phase response. All biomarkers were assayed in duplicate, with intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation maintained below 10 %. To address non-normal distributions, values were natural log-transformed prior to analysis.

Soluble E-Selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were measured as indicators of vascular inflammation (; ). C-reactive protein (CRP), a prototypic acute-phase reactant, was assayed using a particle-enhanced immunonephelometric method (BN II platform), enabling high-sensitivity detection of low-grade systemic inflammation (). Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a central pro-inflammatory cytokine, was quantified via two analytic platforms: high-sensitivity ELISA and electrochemiluminescent multiplex assay (Meso Scale Discovery). Additional cytokines measured on the MSD platform included interleukin-8 (IL-8), a neutrophil chemoattractant involved in acute immune response; interleukin-10 (IL-10), an anti-inflammatory regulatory cytokine with immunoregulatory properties; and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), a key upstream activator of NF-κB–mediated inflammatory signaling (). This biomarker panel provides a comprehensive profile of inflammatory activity relevant to aging and social-environmental exposures.

**Urinalysis of Neuroendocrine Function.** Neuroendocrine function was evaluated using overnight urine collection (∼19:00 to 07:00), providing a cumulative hormonal output index over the sleep interval. This sampling window minimizes diurnal fluctuation and yields a stable index of HPA and SAM system activation. Cortisol and its metabolite cortisone were quantified via competitive radioimmunoassay following organic solvent extraction. Elevated concentrations reflect greater HPA axis activation. Catecholamines—norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine—were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, indexing SAM system activity over a 12-h interval. To account for variability in urine volume, catecholamine concentrations were normalized to total 12-h excretion mass. All hormone values were natural log–transformed prior to analysis to correct for right-skewed distributions.

**Covariates.** All models adjusted for demographic and socioeconomic variables selected *a priori* for their potential to confound associations between CSA and biological aging indicators. Covariates included age (in years), sex (male vs. female), race/ethnicity (White, Black, Other), educational attainment (12-point ordinal scale), and log-transformed current household income (USD). These variables were treated as exogenous predictors—assumed to temporally precede both CSA and biological outcomes—and were included to block potential backdoor paths and minimize bias.

Each covariate is theoretically and empirically linked to both social and biological processes. Age is a primary determinant of both social network dynamics and physiological aging, influencing immunosenescence and inflammatory profiles (). Sex shapes patterns of social interaction and is associated with baseline differences in glucocorticoid and cytokine levels, likely mediated by hormonal and genetic mechanisms (). Race and ethnicity capture exposure to cumulative structural disadvantage—such as systemic discrimination and unequal access to healthcare—which influence both social opportunity and stress physiology (). Educational attainment and income reflect stratified access to material and psychosocial resources that affect both health behavior and biological risk processes (). Treating these covariates as exogenous minimizes bias due to confounding while avoiding over-adjustment for potential mediators or introducing collider bias ().

### 2.4. Statistical analysis

Hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling (SEM) implemented in the R package lavaan (), which allows for simultaneous estimation of latent constructs and their associations with multiple observed outcomes. This approach is well-suited to modeling CSA as a second-order construct and testing its multivariate associations with biomarkers.

**Structural Model.** In the structural phase, each biological outcome variable was regressed on the second-order CSA construct, adjusting for a set of eight exogenous covariates: centered linear and quadratic age terms, sex (0 = female, 1 = male), race/ethnicity (dummy-coded for Black and Other; White as reference), educational attainment (12-point scale), log-transformed household income (USD), and cohort (0 = MIDUS-II, 1 = MIDUS Refresher). Models were clustered at the family level to accommodate non-independence due to shared family IDs, and a robust sandwich estimator was used for the sampling covariance matrix. Estimation was performed using the robust maximum likelihood (MLR) estimator, which yields standard errors and fit indices robust to nonnormality and unbalanced cluster sizes. Missing data were addressed using Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML), and all exogenous covariates were freely intercorrelated to fully specify their joint distribution.

**Multiple Comparison Correction.** To address multiple testing, we controlled the false discovery rate (FDR) across all 24 tests using the Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) procedure and report BH-adjusted p-values (q-values) (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). Coefficients with *q* < 0.05 were deemed statistically significant, and for these we report false coverage rate (FCR)-adjusted, BH-selected confidence intervals (). For coefficients with *q* > 0.05, we display BH-ordered confidence intervals ($βk±z[1−αk/2]×SEk)$ by ranking p-values across all tests and setting $αk$ = $(km)×0.05,$ where *m*  = 24 (the total number of tests) and *k* is the rank of the *p* -value.

displays standardized loadings for the second-order structure, including both: (1) the loadings of the higher-order CSA factor onto its four first-order domains, and (2) the loadings of those domains onto their constituent indicators. All direct and indirect loadings were significant after FDR correction (*q* < 0.001). presents the proportion of variance each observed indicator contributed to the CSA construct. Indicators related to communal integration emerged as the most empirically salient, including social integration (18.5 %), positive relations with others (10.5 %), and social contribution (9.7 %). Additional contributors included social acceptance (7.7 %), paternal generosity (7.2 %), religious coping (6.9 %), and religious practice (6.8 %). Together, these findings validate the multidimensional structure of CSA while underscoring that communal, relational, and religious forms of engagement play a central role in defining the construct.

Clear socioeconomic gradients also emerged. Higher educational attainment was associated with lower systemic inflammation and slower epigenetic aging, with multiple associations surviving FDR correction (*q*  < 0.01 or *q* < 0.001). Fewer associations were observed for household income, which showed smaller and less consistent effects. Racial disparities were pronounced: Black participants exhibited accelerated epigenetic aging and elevated inflammatory activity, particularly for IL-6, TNF-α, and GrimAge, relative to White participants. Participants categorized as “Other race” showed smaller, more heterogeneous effects. Sex differences generally favored women in epigenetic and neuroendocrine measures, although CRP levels were higher among women. Cohort differences between MIDUS-II and the Refresher sample were minimal after covariate adjustment.

A similar pattern emerged for systemic inflammation, with CSA showing negative associations across all cytokines and vascular adhesion markers (β ≈ −0.01 to −0.11). IL-6, assayed via two platforms, showed the most robust association with CSA and remained significant after FDR correction (*q*  < 0.05). IL-10 and E-Selectin yielded non-significant associations, with confidence intervals overlapping zero and FDR-adjusted *q* -values >0.10.

## 4\. Discussion

This study provides evidence that cumulative social advantage (CSA)—operationalized as a multidimensional latent construct—is associated with slower biological aging and reduced systemic inflammation. Drawing on a large, population-based cohort and a comprehensive panel of molecular, immunological, and neuroendocrine biomarkers, the findings extend the literature on the biological embedding of social conditions () by demonstrating consistent links between sustained social resources and physiological systems central to aging. Viewed through the lenses of life course ), weathering (), and stress buffering perspectives (), the results suggest that accumulated social resources may be associated with sustained health benefits, potentially reflected in biological processes that evolve over years or decades. This integrative framework provides a foundation for interpreting the domain-specific patterns observed in the present analyses and for refining mechanistic hypotheses about how social advantage becomes embedded in the body.

### 4.1. CSA and epigenetic aging

The strongest and most consistent associations were observed in the epigenetic domain. Higher CSA was significantly linked to slower biological aging as indexed by both generations of GrimAge and by DunedinPACE—epigenetic clocks designed to capture mortality risk and the pace of biological aging ; ). These findings build on prior work suggesting that relationship quality and social support predict DNA methylation-based aging acceleration (; ). Notably, the DunedinPACE results suggest that CSA may be associated with differences in the accumulated biological burden and the tempo at which molecular aging unfolds. The pattern is consistent with models positing that social environments regulate the methylome through sustained modulation of stress and immune-related pathways (; ).

### 4.2. CSA and immune aging

### 4.3. CSA and neuroendocrine function

By contrast, CSA showed no significant associations with neuroendocrine function as indexed by overnight urinary cortisol, cortisone, or catecholamines. These null findings may reflect limitations in measurement sensitivity. HPA and SAM axis outputs are characterized by high intraindividual variability and marked circadian dynamics—features that are only partially captured through integrated overnight sampling (). It is also plausible that CSA may be related to stress-related biology primarily through slower-acting regulatory systems—such as epigenetic and inflammatory processes—rather than transient endocrine fluctuations. To resolve these dynamics, future research should leverage high-frequency designs (e.g., diurnal cortisol profiling, ecological momentary assessment) capable of capturing within-day hormonal variability in response to social exposure.

## 5\. Limitations and future directions

Measurement constraints also extend to the neuroendocrine outcomes. The use of overnight urine collection, while practical for large-scale field studies, lacks the temporal resolution to capture dynamic hormonal patterns. More intensive protocols, such as serial saliva sampling or ambulatory hormone monitoring, may yield a clearer picture of how social advantage shapes endocrine regulation (; ). Likewise, although the observed pattern of associations is consistent with stress-buffering mechanisms operating over longer timescales, the absence of direct measures of stress exposure and reactivity limits our ability to assess these processes explicitly. Incorporating such measures into longitudinal designs will be important for identifying the specific contexts in which CSA is most strongly associated with indicators of physiological protection.

## 6\. Conclusion

Cumulative social advantage emerges as a consistent and multidimensional predictor of more favorable biological aging profiles, including reduced systemic inflammation and decelerated epigenetic aging. These findings support the hypothesis that sustained access to diverse social resources is embedded in physiological systems that govern the pace of biological aging. By integrating theoretically grounded measures of social conditions with robust molecular and immunological biomarkers, this study advances understanding of how social advantage is associated with biological resilience. Future research should prioritize longitudinal and mechanistic designs to clarify how distinct dimensions of social integration influence the molecular architecture of aging and identify pathways amenable to intervention.
