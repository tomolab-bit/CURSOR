## What are the personal income tax declaration documents for individuals with income from capital transfer who directly declare tax to the tax authority?

Pursuant to Section 9.4 of Appendix I issued with [Decree 126/2020/ND-CP,](https://thuvienphapluat.vn/van-ban/Thue-Phi-Le-Phi/Nghi-dinh-126-2020-ND-CP-huong-dan-Luat-Quan-ly-thue-455733.aspx?anchor=chuong_pl) the personal income tax declaration dossier for individuals with income from capital transfer who directly declare tax to the tax authority includes:

\- Personal income tax declaration (applicable to individuals with income from capital contribution transfer, individuals transferring securities declaring directly to tax authorities and organizations and individuals declaring and paying taxes on behalf of individuals) form No. 04/CNV-TNCN (issued with Appendix II issued with [Circular 80/2021/TT-BTC](https://thuvienphapluat.vn/van-ban/Thue-Phi-Le-Phi/Thong-tu-80-2021-TT-BTC-huong-dan-Luat-Quan-ly-thue-Nghi-dinh-126-2020-ND-CP-466716.aspx?anchor=chuong_pl_3) ).

\- Copy of Capital Transfer Contract.

\- A copy of the document determining the value of capital contribution according to accounting books. In case of capital contribution due to repurchase, there must be a transfer contract upon purchase.

\- Copies of documents proving expenses related to determining income from capital contribution transfer activities specified in Appendix I issued with [Decree 126/2020/ND-CP](https://thuvienphapluat.vn/van-ban/Thue-Phi-Le-Phi/Nghi-dinh-126-2020-ND-CP-huong-dan-Luat-Quan-ly-thue-455733.aspx) ).

## What income is subject to tax from capital transfer activities?

According to Clause 1, Article 14 [of Circular 78/2014/TT-BTC,](https://thuvienphapluat.vn/van-ban/Doanh-nghiep/Thong-tu-78-2014-TT-BTC-huong-dan-218-2013-ND-CP-thi-hanh-Luat-Thue-thu-nhap-doanh-nghiep-236976.aspx?anchor=dieu_14) income from capital transfer is regulated as follows:

> ***Income from capital transfer***

> *1\. Scope of application:*

> *Income from capital transfer of an enterprise is income obtained from transferring part or all of the capital of an enterprise invested in one or more other organizations or individuals (including the case of selling an enterprise). The time of determining income from capital transfer is the time of transferring capital ownership.*

> *In case an enterprise sells the entire single-member limited liability company owned by an organization in the form of capital transfer associated with real estate, it shall declare and pay corporate income tax according to real estate transfer activities and declare according to the corporate income tax declaration (form No. 08) issued with this Circular.*

> *In case an enterprise transfers capital and receives it not in cash but in assets or other material benefits (stocks, fund certificates, etc.) and generates income, it must pay corporate income tax. The value of assets, stocks, fund certificates, etc. is determined based on the selling price of the product on the market at the time of receiving the assets.*

> ....

Thus, taxable income from capital transfer activities of enterprises is the following income:

\- Income obtained from transferring a part of the invested enterprise to one or more other organizations or individuals

\- Income obtained from transferring all capital of an enterprise invested to one or more other organizations or individuals (including the case of selling an enterprise)

The time to determine income from capital transfer is the time of transferring capital ownership.

## Which tax period applies to capital gains?

Article 7 of [the 2007 Law on Personal Income Tax,](https://thuvienphapluat.vn/van-ban/Thue-Phi-Le-Phi/Luat-thue-thu-nhap-ca-nhan-2007-04-2007-QH12-59652.aspx?anchor=dieu_7) amended by Clause 3, Article 1 [of the 2012 amended Law on Personal Income Tax,](https://thuvienphapluat.vn/van-ban/Thue-Phi-Le-Phi/Luat-thue-thu-nhap-ca-nhan-sua-doi-2012-26-2012-QH13-152719.aspx?anchor=chuong_1) stipulates the period for calculating personal income tax as follows:

> ***Tax period***

> *1\. The tax calculation period for resident individuals is prescribed as follows:*

> *a) Annual tax calculation period applies to business income; income from salaries and wages;*

> *b) Tax calculation period for each time income arises applies to income from capital investment; income from capital transfer, except income from securities transfer; income from real estate transfer; income from winning prizes; income from royalties; income from franchising; income from inheritance; income from gifts;*

> *c. Tax calculation period for each transfer or per year for income from securities transfer.*

> *2\. The tax period for non-resident individuals is calculated for each time income arises and applies to all taxable income.*

Thus, income from capital transfer will be subject to tax calculation period for each time income arises.

***Note:*** *The tax period for each income generation does not apply to income from securities transfer.*
