## Abstract

  

Antagonism is a personality domain located in most major trait models and is central to multiple personality disorders. This construct has been linked to many societally harmful externalizing behaviors (e.g., criminal conduct). Consequently, accurate assessment of this trait is important in both research and clinical settings. The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-3 (MMPI-3) is among the most widely used personality assessment instruments, and both researchers and clinicians using it can benefit from proper assessment of antagonism. Although the Personality Psychopathology Five measures aggressiveness (AGGR), a conceptual cognate to antagonism, its content is restricted. Thus, the current studies aimed to develop and validate a new MMPI-3 Antagonism (ANT) scale using six different samples drawn from university, community, and mental health settings (*n* s = 289–1,660). Scale development (Study 1) was approached using criterion validity and latent modeling methods with a series of conceptually indicated candidate items. The resulting scale had improved content coverage of antagonism when compared to the AGGR scale. Subsequent validation analyses (Study 2) examined the ANT scale in terms of convergent and incremental validity against antagonism criteria, as well as its discriminant validity against disinhibition criteria. The results largely supported superior construct validity of ANT scale scores over those of AGGR, indicating that the ANT scale has promise as meaningful addition to the MMPI-3 in the assessment of this construct.

Antagonism (vs. agreeableness) is a bipolar broadband personality domain that can be located in most dominant normative and maladaptive personality models (Lynam & Miller, 2019), including the Five Factor Model (FFM; e.g., Costa & McCrae, 1985) of personality, the *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders*, fifth edition (*DSM-5*) Alternative Model of Personality Disorders (AMPD; American Psychiatric Association \[APA\], 2022), and 11th revision of the *International Classification of Diseases* (*ICD-11*) personality disorder trait model (World Health Organization, 2023). Individuals who are high on antagonism have a substantial impact on public health and safety (see Lynam & Miller, 2019, for a review). This personality domain has, for instance, been empirically linked to a broad range of externalizing behaviors, including criminal and other forms of antisocial conduct (Johnson et al., 2018; Sleep et al., 2018), aggression (Johnson et al., 2018), substance misuse (Johnson et al., 2018; Sleep et al., 2018), and problematic traffic behaviors (Beanland et al., 2014). In addition, antagonism is a potent predictor of low relationship satisfaction (particularly from the partner’s perspective) and relationship quality (Lamkin & Lavner, 2019). Lynam and Miller (2019) argued that given the costs to society and individual victims, more research attention should be afforded to this domain. We concur and argue that accurate clinical assessment of this domain is, therefore, very important for both researchers and clinicians. This current project is focused on the assessment of antagonism using a well-established measure in clinical psychology practice, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-3 (MMPI-3; Ben-Porath & Tellegen, 2020a). More specifically, we aimed to develop and validate a new MMPI-3 scale designed to assess this construct.

### Construct Definition

Our focus is on the assessment of maladaptive antagonism from the perspective of contemporary dimensional models of personality disorder (AMPD and *ICD-11*), though it is important to note that these models have been greatly influenced by the FFM. Antagonism emerged as one of the domains in the development of the AMPD through a structural analysis of specific personality traits during the development of the Personality Inventory for *DSM-5* (PID-5; Krueger et al., 2012). Specifically, this initial research showed that antagonism was defined as a higher order domain that encompassed manipulativeness, deceitfulness, grandiosity, attention seeking, callousness, and hostility. Two separate meta- analyses of the PID-5 have subsequently replicated these findings with robust agreement (Somma et al., 2019; Watters & Bagby, 2018). The *ICD-11* definition of dissociality (i.e., antagonism) emerged through initial work by Mulder et al. (2011, 2016) who initially observed a broader antisocial factor, which was a mix of dissociality and disinhibition markers, with subsequent work consistently showing that dissociality and disinhibition are separate domains in *ICD-11* personality structure (e.g., Bach et al., 2017, 2020; J. R. Oltmanns & Widiger, 2018). In *ICD-11*, dissociality is defined as disregard for the rights and feelings of others, encompassing both self-centeredness (e.g., grandiosity, sense of entitlement, egocentricity, and attention seeking) and lack of empathy (e.g., callousness, remorselessness, manipulation, deceitfulness, and AGG; World Health Organization, 2023).

Crowe et al. (2018) conducted an analysis of 22 trait scales relevant to the agreeableness–antagonism domain in a large community sample. They observed that the various trait facets could be organized according to five broader features that themselves are subsumed under an even broader higher order antagonism domain. These domains were callousness (vs. compassion), which was defined by lower order traits of exploitativeness, callousness, and ruthlessness; immorality (vs. morality) as defined by manipulativeness, deceitfulness, and being cunning; distrust (vs. trust) defined by being skeptical, suspicious, and cynical; combativeness (vs. affability) defined by oppositionality, aggressiveness, and being quarrelsome; and arrogance (vs. modesty) as defined by boastfulness, egocentricity, and self-centeredness.

Taken together, antagonism in the AMPD and dissociality in the *ICD-11* are virtually identical with respect to the underlying traits that comprise them, and four of Crowe et al.’s (2018) five traits appear in their definitions as well. The primary difference of the AMPD and *ICD-11* operationalization of antagonism from the FFM and Crowe et al., however, is that attention seeking is more directly linked to excessive manifestation of extraversion in the FFM framework (Widiger & Oltmanns, 2019). Moreover, distrust, which emerged as a major domain of antagonism in Crowe et al.’s (2018) analyses (and with trust being a facet of agreeableness in the FFM), does not appear prominently in the description of the maladaptive definitions of this domain. Indeed, mistrust (or suspiciousness) does not load meaningfully on agreeableness in structural analyses (e.g., Somma et al., 2019; Watters & Bagby, 2018). Rather, in the AMPD and *ICD-11*, suspiciousness loads on the negative affectivity domain and (in the AMPD) on detachment. These divergences notwithstanding, antagonism clearly has more similarities than differences across these prominent personality models.

### MMPI-3 Assessment of Antagonism

The MMPI-3 is the most recent version of the MMPI family of instruments. It is a 335-item true/false self-report inventory that measures a wide range of dimensional clinically relevant psychological constructs that map onto contemporary models of psychopathology and personality (e.g., J. R. Brown et al., 2023; T. A. Brown & Sellbom, 2023a; Sellbom et al., 2021). The MMPI instruments are among the most frequently used in clinical psychology practice (Wright et al., 2017) and training (Mihura et al., 2017; Villanueva van den Hurk et al., 2024).

Since the MMPI-2, the instrument has included an operationalization of the Personality Psychopathology Five (PSY-5; Harkness & McNulty, 1994) model on each of its versions. The PSY-5 is a dimensional maladaptive personality trait model that serves the same function as the trait models included in the AMPD and *ICD-11*. Indeed, the PSY-5 and AMPD trait domains have a direct one-to-one conceptual correspondence (e.g., Harkness et al., 2012) and have substantial empirical overlap (e.g., Anderson et al., 2013, 2015; T. A. Brown & Sellbom, 2023a). Aggressiveness is the conceptual cognate to antagonism, but we argue here that the MMPI-3 PSY-5 scale operationalization of this domain does not sufficiently reflect the broader antagonism construct, and the measurement of the latter on the MMPI-3 can be improved.

The PSY-5 Aggressiveness (AGGR) scale has the smallest correlations with its AMPD/ *ICD-11* counterparts compared to the other PSY-5 scales in previous studies; these correlations have ranged from.42 to.60 with a median *r* =.44 across a range of university, community, and clinical samples (Anderson & Sellbom, 2021; Anderson et al., 2013, 2015; T. A. Brown & Sellbom, 2023a; Carnovale et al., 2020; Sellbom, 2020; Tarescavage & Menton, 2020). In addition, AGGR has typically not outperformed the PSY-5 Disconstraint (DISC; the equivalent of the AMPD/ *ICD-11* disinhibition domain) scale in these associations, as the latter scale correlations with antagonism/dissociality measures having ranged from.33 to.59, with a median *r* =.44, across these same studies.

The weaker than expected convergent validity could be because of item content. The largest proportion of the content of the 15-item MMPI-3 AGGR scale focuses on assertiveness and dominance, with instrumental aggression, callousness, and reactive aggression being covered with two items each, and stress resilience with one item. Thus, AGGR only covers two of Crowe et al.’s (2018) components (callousness and combativeness). The absence of deceitfulness and manipulativeness, grandiosity, and attention seeking also departs from *ICD-11* and AMPD perspectives, though as stated earlier, the latter facet is not universally accepted as a feature of the antagonism domain.

Other MMPI-3 scales are therefore needed for a fuller, albeit indirect, assessment of antagonism. In Appendix B of the *MMPI-3 Technical Manual*, Sellbom (2020) hypothesized that the core conceptual measures of antagonism on the MMPI-3 are AGGR, aggression (AGG), and cynicism (CYN), with self-importance (SFI), dominance (DOM), and disaffiliativeness (DSF) also assessing relevant features. Sellbom (2020) also presented some preliminary results from both community and university samples that these scales were more strongly correlated with a set of antagonism-externalizing psychopathology criteria more so than disinhibition-externalizing criteria. Furthermore, Sellbom et al. (2021) found support for an MMPI-3 scale structure that they mapped onto the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (Kotov et al., 2017) model in two large mental health and prison samples, with the aforementioned scales loading on an antagonism-externalizing factor along with anger proneness (ANP) and family problems (FML). Although these various scales can be used to assess various elements of antagonism (e.g., T. A. Brown & Sellbom, 2023a), none were explicitly designed for this purpose and do not form a succinct higher order scale.

## Study 1

  

The first study aimed to select items for the MMPI-3 ANT scale and evaluate its psychometric properties. We took a multistep approach to development that focused on balancing important psychometric properties (content breadth and internal consistency reliability) across three different contexts (general community, university, and mental health).

### Method

#### Participants and Procedures

We used a total of six samples at different stages of scale development. One of these samples is also included in Study 2 (the New Zealand community mental health sample) and is described in greater detail there. Regarding the samples that are exclusive to Study 1, the first sample comprised 529 university students from a New Zealand university. Participants in this sample were recruited through a psychology research participation program to complete a series of self-report questionnaires in groups of up to 12 while being monitored by a trained research assistant. Participants were compensated with course-required research credits. The second sample comprised 355 participants who received standard instructions as part of a larger response style simulation study at a large midwestern United States university (with the total sample comprising 1,071 participants). In this sample, participants also completed a series of self-report questionnaires in groups of up to 10 while being monitored by a trained research assistant and were compensated with course-required research credits. Participants were excluded from analyses based on protocol validity standards outlined in the *MMPI-3 Manual* *for Administration, Scoring, and Interpretation* (cannot say ≥ 18 \[raw\]; combined response inconsistency, variable response inconsistency, or true response inconsistency ≥ 80T; infrequent responses or infrequent psychopathology responses ≥ 100T; Ben-Porath & Tellegen, 2020a), which yielded final sample sizes of *n* = 489 (New Zealand university sample), *n* = 286 (midwestern United States university sample), and *n* = 289 (New Zealand community mental health sample). These three samples were used in the first stage of scale development, which required the use of external criteria (described later).

The final three samples, which were used for structural analyses, included the MMPI-3 normative sample (*n* = 1,620), another large university sample from New Zealand (*n* = 1,821), and a combined mental health sample from the United States (*n* = 1,854). The MMPI-3 normative sample is a representation of the United States community population (see Ben-Porath & Tellegen, 2020b). The final sample included 1,591 participants after excluding participants with invalid MMPI-3 protocols. The second New Zealand university sample (final *n* = 1,660 after the exclusion of invalid MMPI-3 protocols) was collected using the same procedures and in the same setting as the first New Zealand university sample. The mental health sample was adult outpatients drawn from four sites in the United States: a midwestern private practice (*n* = 571; 31%), a midwestern community mental health clinic (*n* = 854; 46%), a midwestern university counseling clinic (*n* = 246; 13%), and a doctoral program (clinical psychology) training clinic at a southeastern state university (*n* = 183; 10%). The final sample included 1,537 participants. [Table S1 in the online supplemental materials](https://doi.org/10.1037/per0000710.supp) lists basic demographic information for each sample.

#### Measures

##### All Samples

###### MMPI-3 (Ben-Porath & Tellegen, 2020a)

The MMPI-3 is a broadband measure of personality and psychopathology that contains 335 dichotomous items. There are 10 protocol validity scales and 42 substantive scales, which are arranged in a hierarchical pattern beginning with the Higher-Order scales, then the Restructured Clinical Scales, the Specific Problems Scales, and the PSY-5 Scales. Extensive information regarding scale reliability and validity is provided in the *MMPI-3* *Technical Manual* (Ben-Porath & Tellegen, 2020b). For the current study, only item-level data were used to derive the ANT scale.

##### University Samples

###### Comprehensive Assessment of Traits Relevant to Personality Disorder-Static Form (CAT-PD-SF; Simms et al., 2011)

The CAT-PD-SF is a 216-item self-report measure of dimensional maladaptive personality traits. Participants endorse CAT-PD-SF items using a 5-point descriptive scale, ranging from 1 (*very untrue of me*) to 5 (*very true of me*). Each CAT-PD-SF item corresponds to one of the 33 trait scales (e.g., affective lability and anger), which can be used to score scales measuring the AMPD and *ICD-11* trait model constructs. The current study used only the antagonism domain score.

##### Clinical Sample Only

###### DSM-5 Clinician’ Personality Trait Rating Form (APA, 2010)

The ratings of participant standings on AMPD trait model constructs were derived from clinical research assistants rating the degree to which the domain and facet level dimensions in this model were descriptive of participants. This was done on a 4-point descriptive scale, ranging from 0 (*very little or not at all descriptive*) to 3 (*extremely descriptive*). The current study used the antagonism domain rating.

### Scale Development, Results, and Discussion

The first step in the development of the MMPI-3 ANT scale was the identification of candidate items. We first considered items on already existing scales that we deemed most conceptually relevant to the broader construct (see Sellbom, 2020) and replicated in subsequent analyses (Sellbom et al., 2021). These scales were AGGR, AGG, CYN, SFI, DOM, and DSF. This yielded an initial item pool composed of 47 candidate items.

In an initial step, we calculated point-biserial correlations between the candidate items and external antagonism domain criterion measures in the first New Zealand university student sample (*n* = 489), the midwestern United States university student sample (*n* = 286), and the New Zealand community mental health sample (*n* = 289). Our use of archival databases allowed us to incorporate external criteria for this initial process, which is not typically available in scale construction projects. We deemed this step to be important because we were using an existing item pool to construct the ANT scale (i.e., we could not write our own antagonism-specific items), so this process endured the selection of items that converged with the construct of interest. Correlations between these items and the included self-report criteria were considered meaningful (thus carried to the next phase of analyses) at *r pb* ≥ |.15|. Correlations between candidate items and clinician-rated criteria were considered meaningful at *r pb* ≥ |.10|. These a priori thresholds were selected because.15 is a common threshold for acceptable average interitem correlations (AIC) for self-report scales (Clark & Watson, 1995), and a slightly lower threshold of at least a small effect size magnitude was selected for the clinician ratings because of the heteromethod comparison. These relatively low thresholds also allowed for overinclusiveness at this initial stage. Items that met this threshold for at least three of the five criterion measures (and across at least two samples) were retained for the next step. This process led to the exclusion of 14 items (see [Table S2 in the online supplemental materials](https://doi.org/10.1037/per0000710.supp) for an overview of which items were removed/added at each step of analyses), leaving us with 33 items for the next phase of analyses. For all candidate item point-biserial correlation results, see [Table S3 in the online supplemental materials](https://doi.org/10.1037/per0000710.supp).

The second step, which was inspired by Noordhof et al.’s (2015) sophisticated approach in developing a higher order scale, involved subjecting the remaining 33 items to an exploratory bifactor analysis (Jennrich & Bentler, 2011). This approach differs from a traditional bifactor analysis in that the group scale level is based on factor rotation. Indeed, it is fundamentally an exploratory factor analysis in which a specific rotation method is applied such that the first factor is unrotated and represents a general factor, and subsequent factors are rotated using a standard method (the current study utilized geomin rotation, specifying five group factors based on the number of scales from which items were retained in the previous step). This approach allowed for the identification of items that were sufficiently associated with the common variance across the remaining candidate items (i.e., general antagonism factor) when also accounting for the systematic variances underlying the lower-order structure. This analysis was conducted using the MMPI-3 normative sample, the composite mental health sample, and the second (larger) New Zealand University sample. Our a priori requirement was that items loading onto the general factor at a magnitude of |.30| in at least two of the three samples were considered to be meaningfully representative of the general factor and were consequently retained. This resulted in the exclusion of 11 additional items, leaving us with 22 items for the next phase of analyses. For all general factor loadings in each sample, see [Table S4 in the online supplemental materials](https://doi.org/10.1037/per0000710.supp).

Our third step in the item-identification process was also inspired by Noordhof et al.’s (2015) methodology. The two previously described steps aimed to develop a sufficiently robust, relatively homogenous (for a higher-order construct) antagonism item pool that could subsequently be used to extract additional items from scales peripheral to the antagonism domain that were nevertheless judged to potentially include antagonism-relevant items. The other MMPI-3 scales that were deemed to be composed of at least some items with conceptual relevance to antagonism included behavioral/externalizing dysfunction (BXD), antisocial behavior (RC4), hypomanic activation (RC9), FML, DISC, and (reversed) self-doubt (SFD). In separate analyses for each of these scales, the items, along with the ANT scale candidate items retained from the second step, were subjected to exploratory structural equation modeling with targeted rotation (Asparouhov & Muthén, 2009). Specifically, we used targeted rotations to specify an antagonism factor with the approximate retained ANT item loadings observed in the exploratory bifactor analyses. Additional exploratory structural equation modeling factors were also specified to account for the items that would not load meaningfully onto the antagonism factor. The number of additional factors needed for the heterogeneous candidate scales (i.e., BXD, RC4, RC9, and DISC) was determined by subjecting the items of each to an exploratory factor analysis to elucidate their natural structures in our samples; the specific problems scales (i.e., FML and SFD) were assumed to be unidimensional and we therefore allowed for only one additional factor for those scale items. All ANT items were specified to target load onto the additional factor(s) at approximately zero. No target loadings were specified for the candidate items from each scale, which allowed us to determine whether the items would load preferentially on the antagonism factor versus their own factor(s). Candidate items were retained for the ANT scale if, in at least two of the samples used in the second step, they loaded onto the antagonism factor more strongly than their own factor(s), the loading onto the antagonism factor was at least |.30|, and the content was independently judged by the coauthors to have conceptual relevance to the antagonism construct. This process led to the inclusion of six additional items, leaving 28 items on the scale for the final phase of analyses.

The final step was scale refinement through internal consistency analyses and content review to determine whether any of the items retained from the third step should be removed because of insufficient construct convergence and construct irrelevance, respectively. We specifically relied on Cronbach’s α, AIC, and corrected item-to-total correlations to inform our decision on which (if any) items to remove. Items that substantially detracted from internal consistency were removed unless deemed critical to covering specific antagonism content not already covered by other items. Setting a minimum standard of Cronbach’s α and AIC of.70 and.15, respectively, in all three samples, and a minimum corrected item-to-total correlations of |.15| in at least two of the three samples resulted in the removal of six items. This yielded a scale composed of 22 items. For all three samples, these internal consistency statistics are displayed in [Table S5 in the online supplemental materials](https://doi.org/10.1037/per0000710.supp).

Finally, items that were deemed too peripheral to the antagonism construct were considered for removal in the final content review as well. However, this did not result in the removal of any additional items. Thus, the final ANT scale is composed of 22 items and shares items with AGGR (eight items), AGG (six items), CYN (10 items), SFI (one item), DOM (two items), DSF (one item), and FML (one item).1 Although ANT shares items with multiple other MMPI-3 scales, this is not uncommon for a higher-order scale. Moreover, the unbalanced item overlap reflects the degree to which the scales themselves are conceptually relevant to antagonism (Sellbom, 2020). For example, the greater representation of AGG and CYN items parallels the greater relevance of these scales to antagonism vis-à-vis the other scales that focus on more specific aspects of this construct. It is further noteworthy that while AGGR is the closest analog for the antagonism construct on the MMPI-3, less than half of the ANT items overlap with AGGR, which is owing to the restricted content coverage of this latter scale as discussed earlier. Indeed, the ANT scale has better content coverage of Crowe et al.’s (2018) features of antagonism than does AGGR, in that its item content covers all five facets (callousness, immorality, distrust, combativeness, and arrogance). As noted earlier, AGGR has item content that primarily covers the callousness and combativeness facets. More specifically for the ANT scale, three items from SFI and CYN cover the arrogance domain. Three ANT items that also appear on CYN and DSF provide coverage of the distrust domain. Callousness is covered via three items shared with AGG, CYN, and AGGR, whereas combativeness is best represented through eight items that also appear on FML, DOM, AGG, and AGGR. Finally, immorality is covered with five items that all appear on the CYN scale.

In addition, the ANT items can also be distributed in accordance with five of the six AMPD facets for antagonism, specifically, manipulativeness and deceitfulness (CYN items), callousness (AGG, CYN, and AGGR items), grandiosity (SFI and CYN items), and hostility (FML, AGG, and AGGR items). To determine whether the ANT scale might have similar antagonism representation as other such measures, we conducted a post hoc analysis in which we tested a one-factor confirmatory factor analysis model in the New Zealand community mental health sample (as this is the only sample that included at least two external measures of antagonism/dissociality). Specifically, we derived a model in which ANT scores, as well as those on the Antagonism and Dissociality scales on the PID-5-SF and PiCD, respectively, were regressed onto a single latent factor. Scores on the MMPI-3 ANT (λ =.66), PID-5-SF ANT (λ =.82), and PiCD Dissociality (λ =.95) scales all loaded meaningful onto this factor, indicating similar content coverage of the ANT scale compared to these established antagonism/dissociality measures. It is worth noting, however, that neither ANT nor AGGR scale has explicit item content relevant to the more preliminary antagonism facet of attention seeking. This issue, as well as the smaller magnitude (albeit still meaningful) loading of ANT scores relative to the other two measures in the CFA model, is likely because the MMPI-3 item pool is imperfect in terms of its coverage of antagonism content. More comprehensive item content notwithstanding, an empirical examination of the construct validity of the ANT scale is necessary for determining its improvement as a measure of maladaptive antagonism vis-à-vis AGGR.

## Study 2

  

The primary objective of Study 2 was to evaluate the construct and incremental validity of the new MMPI-3 ANT scale, with a particular emphasis on comparing it to PSY-5 AGGR and DISC scales in the prediction of antagonism- and disinhibition-relevant criteria. More specifically, we used five archival databases, which had conceptually relevant domain (and in some instances, facet level) measures of antagonism and disinhibition. In a mental health sample, we also had measures of personality disorder symptoms most relevant to antagonism, including paranoid, antisocial, borderline, and narcissistic personality disorder (see e.g., Sellbom, 2019). We also had a clinician-rated AMPD impairment measure to determine the degree to which the ANT scale was associated with personality dysfunction (including in comparison to AGGR). We hypothesized that ANT would outperform AGGR (and the rest of the PSY-5 scales) in the prediction of antagonism-relevant variables given improved construct breadth, whereas DISC would evince larger associations with disinhibition-relevant variables. Furthermore, we examined whether ANT scores would exhibit incremental validity above and beyond AGGR scores in the prediction of antagonism domains. Again, we hypothesized that we would see evidence for incremental validity (and to a greater degree than AGGR scores over ANT scores).

### Method

#### Participants and Procedures

##### University Samples (Samples 1–4)

Samples 1–4 were all composed of undergraduate students from the same large university in the midwestern United States who completed the MMPI-3 along with various other self-report measures of psychopathology on laptop computers in groups of 15 or less. Participants were compensated with course-required research participation credits. Full sample sizes ranged from *n* = 354 to 964. All participants were screened for valid MMPI-3 protocols using the criteria described in Study 1. After applying these exclusion criteria, sample sizes ranged from *n* = 315–878. For all university sample demographic information, see [Table S6 in the online supplemental materials](https://doi.org/10.1037/per0000710.supp).

##### Community Mental Sample (Sample 5)

Participants in Sample 5 were 289 individuals who were currently engaged in community mental health treatment in Ōtepoti, Aotearoa (Dunedin, New Zealand). Participants were recruited through flyer placement in the community, at a diverse range of treatment centers, and through online advertisements on Facebook. Adverts stated that participants must be currently receiving any form of mental health treatment (e.g., for depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, substance use, and anger management), be over the age of 18, and able to comprehend English at a Grade 7 level. Participants were included in the current study if they met the MMPI-3 validity scale inclusion criteria described earlier. For full demographic data for this sample, see [Table S6 in the online supplemental materials](https://doi.org/10.1037/per0000710.supp). The ages in this sample ranged from 18 to 70 (*M* = 27.46, *SD* = 9.82). Among the included participants, 66.1% were women, 30.8% were men, 2.1% were transgender, and 0.7% were nonbinary. Gender information was not disclosed by one participant. The most common self-reported diagnoses within the sample were anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder and eating disorders. Readers are referred to T. A. Brown and Sellbom (2023b, 2023c)*,* for more detail about this sample.

#### Measures

Descriptive statistics and reliability information are available in [Table S7 in the online supplemental materials](https://doi.org/10.1037/per0000710.supp).

##### Clinician Ratings—Sample 5 Only

###### Semistructured Interview for Personality Functioning DSM-5 (STIP 5.1; Hutsebaut et al., 2017)

The STIP 5.1 is a semistructured clinical interview designed for the assessment of the *DSM-5* AMPD personality dysfunction domains that was used in Sample 5. The STIP 5.1 is a 12-part interview, with each part aimed to gather knowledge for each domain and each facet of the AMPD Levels of Personality Functioning Scale (LPFS). After each series of questions, the clinician is required to rate the severity of personality dysfunction for each facet on a 4-point descriptive scale, ranging from 0 (*no dysfunction*) to 4 (*extreme dysfunction*), before making an overall domain rating. The domains include identity, self-direction, empathy, and intimacy. The measure also yields a total score, representing overall personality dysfunction.

###### DSM-5 Clinicians’ Personality Trait Rating Form (APA, 2010)

The ratings of participant standings on AMPD trait model constructs were derived from clinical research assistants, which were described in Study 1. The current study utilized all trait domain ratings, as well individual antagonism facet ratings.

##### Self-Report Measures

###### MMPI-3 (Ben-Porath & Tellegen, 2020a)

The MMPI-3 is a broadband measure of personality and psychopathology that contains 335 dichotomous items; this instrument has been described throughout. For the current study, we scored the new ANT scale, as well as the PSY-5 scales. The MMPI-3 was administered in all samples.

###### CAT-PD-SF (Simms et al., 2011)

The CAT-PD-SF is a 216-item self-report measure of dimensional maladaptive personality traits and was described in Study 1. The overall AMPD trait domain scores used were calculated through the inclusion of all CAT-PD-SF trait scales relevant to each domain (see [Table S8 in the online supplemental materials](https://doi.org/10.1037/per0000710.supp)), as ascertained through facets included in the AMPD, *ICD-11* criteria, and consultation of the CAT-PD literature on higher order structure (e.g., Long et al., 2021; Ringwald et al., 2023; Simms et al., 2011). This was administered in Sample 1.

###### PID-5 (Krueger et al., 2012)

The PID-5 is a 220-item self-report measure of the *DSM-5* trait model, including all five maladaptive traits and all 25 facets. Items are rated on a 4-point descriptive scale, ranging from 0 (*very false or often false*) to 3 (*very true or often true*). The five trait domains were scored using the full-facet scoring approach described by Watters et al. (2019). This version of the PID-5 was administered in Sample 4.

###### PID-5-SF (Maples et al., 2015)

The PID-5-SF is a 107-item version of the original PID-5 item pool that was developed to measure the traits in the *DSM-5* AMPD and was described in Study 1. This measure was only administered in Sample 5.

###### PiCD (J. R. Oltmanns & Widiger, 2018)

The PiCD is a 60-item self-report measure of the five proposed domains for the *ICD-11* (Mulder et al., 2016) and was described in Study 1. The self-report version of the PiCD was administered in Samples 3 and 5.

###### Five-Factor Model Rating Form (FFMRF; Mullins-Sweatt et al., 2006)

The FFMRF is a 30-item rating form on which participants rate themselves on the six facets of each of the five domains of the FFM on a 5-point descriptive scale, ranging from 5 (*extremely high*) to 1 (*extremely low*). Domain scores are derived from the sum of the relevant facet item ratings. This measure was administered to participants in Sample 5.

###### Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Screening Personality Questionnaire (SCID-5-SPQ; First et al., 2016)

###### Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory-Short Form (Sherman et al., 2015)

The Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory-Short Form is a 60-item version of the full 148-item version (Glover et al., 2012) that measures several facets of grandiose and vulnerable narcissism from the perspective of the FFM. The facet scales can also be scored as Antagonism and Extraversion factor scales, which were used in Sample 2.

##### Informant Report—Sample 5 Only

###### Personality Inventory for DSM-5, Brief Form Plus–Informant Version (I-PID5BF+; T. A. Brown & Sellbom, 2024)

The informant version of the Personality Inventory for *DSM-5*, Brief Form Plus (I-PID5BF+) is an alteration of the self-report PID5BF+ (Kerber et al., 2022), so that both the instructions and items are worded to reflect that the rater is rating someone else (e.g., items begin with “He …” instead of “I …”). Items are rated on a 4-point descriptive scale, ranging from 0 (*very false or often false*) to 3 (*very true or often true*).

###### Personality Inventory for ICD-11-Informant Version (IPiC; J. R. Oltmanns & Widiger, 2021)

The IPiC is a 60-item informant-report measure of the five proposed domains for the *ICD-11* (Mulder et al., 2016). The informant version is a modification of the self-report version of the PiCD, with instructions and items worded to reflect that the rater is rating another person. Each item is rated on a scale 5-point descriptive scale, ranging from 1 (*strongly disagree*) to 5 (*strongly agree*).

###### FFMRF-Informant Version (Lynam & Widiger, 2001)

The informant version of the FFMRF (Mullins-Sweatt et al., 2006) is a modified version of the self-report version where informants provide the ratings of a person on the six facets of each of the five domains of the FFM on a 5-point descriptive scale, ranging from 5 (*extremely high*) to 1 (*extremely low*). Like the self-report version, domain scores are derived from the sum of the relevant facet item ratings.

###### Levels of Personality Functioning Scale-Brief Form–Informant 2.0 (LPFS-BF 2.0)

The LPFS-BF 2.0 informant is a brief 12-item informant-report questionnaire, identical to the LPFS-BF 2.0 self-report —except the instructions ask the individual to rate the extent each statement applies to the person they are rating, with the same 4-point Likert-type-scale ranging from *very false or often false* to *very true or often true*. It was modified for the data collection for Sample 5 with permission from the LPFS-BF authors.

###### Multisource Assessment of Personality Pathology–Informant (MAPP; T. F. Oltmanns & Turkheimer, 2006)

#### Data Analyses

To examine the convergent and discriminant validity of the ANT scale in comparison to the AGGR and DISC scales, a series of zero-order correlations were calculated between ANT, AGGR, and DISC scale scores and scores of all of the aforementioned criterion measures. ANT was expected to be more highly correlated with the antagonism-relevant variables when compared to AGGR and DISC, whereas DISC was expected to have larger correlations with disinhibition variables relative to ANT. Although no specific predictions are offered regarding ANT associations with domain variables measuring other broadband traits (e.g., negative emotionality, detachment, and psychoticism) relative to the other two MMPI-3 scales, these criteria were included for a comprehensive examination of discriminant validity.

Next, to examine whether ANT scores yielded incremental validity over AGGR scores in the prediction of antagonism criteria, hierarchical linear regression analyses were used. For each antagonism criterion variable, two hierarchical regression models were tested. One in which AGGR was entered in the first step of the model and ANT was entered in the second step. The second model reversed the order of entry of AGGR and ANT. This approach allowed us to evaluate which of the two scales yielded superior incremental prediction above the other. For these analyses, we focused on the overall domain criteria; thus, across the student samples, the criterion variables included CAT-PD antagonism, PiCD dissociality, and PID-5 antagonism scores. In the clinical samples, the domain variables included PID-5-SF and I-PID5BF+ antagonism, PiCD dissociality (self-report and informant report; i.e., IPiC), FFMRF agreeableness (self-report and informant report), and clinician-rated antagonism scores.

Finally, to determine whether ANT scores would emerge as the optimal predictor of antagonism-related criteria relative to the other PSY-5 scales (excluding AGGR) and that excessive disinhibition variance is not reflected in ANT scores, multiple regression with dominance analysis was used. Dominance analysis is an extension of multiple regression posited to more effectively partition explained variance in a given criterion by correlated predictors. This is accomplished by calculating a series of regression models (one for each possible subset of predictors) to compare the average contribution of each predictor to the *R* 2 value across all models (Darlington, 1968). This value is expressed as a dominance weight (*w*), which can range from 0 to 1, reflecting the proportion of predicted variance covered. Because personality domains are assumed to be correlated with one another, this approach was deemed optimal for ensuring that ANT best predicted analogous domain-level criteria, and that it did not encroach on the prediction of disinhibition criteria from DISC. The other PSY-5 domains were included solely for discriminant validity. The antagonism domain criteria were identical to those used in the hierarchical regression analyses. The disinhibition domain criteria in the student samples included the disinhibition scores on the CAT-PD, PiCD, and PID-5, and in the mental health sample, PID-5-SF and I-PID5BF+ disinhibition scores, PiCD disinhibition scores (self-report and informant report; i.e., IPiC), FFMRF conscientiousness scores (self-report and informant report), as well as clinician-rated disinhibition scores.

### Results and Discussion

[Table S9 in the online supplemental materials](https://doi.org/10.1037/per0000710.supp) shows correlations between ANT, AGGR, and DISC across all five samples. As expected, ANT and AGGR exhibited large correlations (*r* s =.56–.69; *Mdn r* =.63). ANT also evinced medium-sized correlations with DISC (*r* s =.38 to.48; *Mdn r* =.41), which were somewhat larger than those between AGGR and DISC (*r* s =.28 to.42; *Mdn r* =.35) but closer to how antagonism and disinhibition self-report measures tend to correlate (see [Table S10 in the online supplemental materials](https://doi.org/10.1037/per0000710.supp) for the current samples; *r* s =.40–.50; *Mdn r* =.45).

#### Zero-Order Correlations

Across the university student samples, ANT scores were associated with strong support for convergent validity with antagonism-related criteria (see Table 1).

Indeed, ANT scale scores were consistently more strongly associated with antagonism domain criteria than AGGR scale scores, albeit at mostly small effect size differences (per Cohen’s *q*) given their substantial overlap. Differences were particularly pronounced in correlations with callousness, hostility, and manipulativeness/deceitfulness. Of note, however, is that AGGR scores yielded better discriminant validity in their associations with criteria related to other trait domains than ANT scores. However, it is worth considering that the associations between scores on antagonism and disinhibition measures are generally correlated beyond a small magnitude, as these constructs tend to form a broader externalizing spectrum, which is predicated on their overlap. Furthermore, DISC consistently yielded the largest association with disinhibition domain and facet scores across all samples as expected. Taken together, these patterns of associations indicate that ANT and DISC scores yield the conceptually expected patterns of discriminant validity regarding their respective externalizing subfactors while also reflecting the overlap between the antagonism and disinhibition constructs. Additionally, several of the criteria from other domains that were meaningfully associated with ANT but not AGGR are relevant to the broader ANT construct (Crowe et al., 2018). For example, ANT scores were meaningfully associated the CAT-PD facet-level negative affectivity scales of anger (*r* =.38) and mistrust (*r* =.48).

The pattern of greater convergent validity of ANT scores with antagonism-related criteria, but worse discriminant validity than AGGR regarding disinhibition-related criteria, was consistent with findings in the clinical sample as well (see Table 2).

Additionally, zero-order correlations in this sample included self- and informant-reported FFMRF Agreeableness scores, which were similarly negatively associated with AGGR at *r* = −.40 and *r* = −.37, respectively. ANT scale scores were associated with FFMRF Agreeableness scores at *r* = −.35 across both self- and informant-report scores. ANT scores, on the other hand, yielded consistently larger associations with clinician-rated antagonism scores (*r* =.42) and personality disorder criteria across all three sources of information. Finally, ANT scores were more strongly associated with general personality dysfunction than those on AGGR, yielding meaningful correlations with STIP total scores at *r* =.40, as well as with the facet scores of identity (*r* =.33), empathy (*r* =.41), and intimacy (*r* =.43). AGGR scores, however, did not yield meaningful associations with any of the STIP scale scores. Similar differences were observed between ANT and AGGR score associations with LPFS-BF 2.0 scores. While ANT score associations were small across LPFS-BF 2.0 variables, including the total score (*r* =.20), and facet scores of identity (*r* =.12), self-direction (*r* =.13), empathy (*r* =.14), and intimacy (*r* =.24), AGGR scores yielded near-zero to negative associations with these variables. These results taken together indicate that ANT may measure a more maladaptive construct than AGGR.

#### Hierarchical Regression

The hierarchical regression analyses supported the incremental validity of ANT scores in predicting antagonism domain-related criteria over and above AGGR scores (see Tables 3

Across the university student samples, the *R* 2 change values in the regression models in which ANT was added in the second block ranged from.08 to.13. The *R* 2 change values for the models in which AGGR was added in the second step ranged from.01 to.05 (see Table 3).ANT scores also consistently yielded larger beta weights for all domain level criteria across the student samples, suggesting a stronger association with the criterion variables when accounting for overlapping variances. In the clinical sample, the hierarchical regression analyses were less clearly supportive of the incremental validity of ANT scores over those on AGGR in predicting antagonism criteria (see Table 4).Indeed, of the seven regression models predicting domain level criteria, there were three instances of AGGR scores incrementing prediction above ANT scores more than the reverse. This was specifically the case in the models predicting self-reported FFMRF agreeableness, informant-reported IPiC dissocial, and FFMRF agreeableness scores, with *R* 2 values of.06,.07, and.04, respectively, when AGGR was added in the second block of the model. This is compared to *R* 2 values of.02,.05, and.03, respectively, when ANT was entered in the second block. However, the remaining regression models stand as additional support for the incremental predictive power of ANT scores above those on AGGR, including the clinicians ’ ratings of antagonism for which the most pronounced difference emerged.

#### Dominance Analyses

Multiple regression with dominance analysis was used in order to ensure that ANT scores emerged as the optimal predictor of antagonism-related criteria relative to the other PSY-5 scale scores (excluding AGGR) and that ANT scores did not outpredict those on DISC in the prediction of disinhibition criteria. Across the student and clinical samples, ANT emerged at the dominant predictor of all antagonism criteria relative to the other PSY-5 scales. Additionally, DISC emerged as the dominant predictor of disinhibition criteria, indicating that the previously described lower discriminant associations of ANT scores with these criteria do not appear to reflect excessive disinhibition variance in ANT scores. For all multiple regression and dominance statistics, see Table 5.

## General Discussion

  

The overall aim of this project was to develop an MMPI-3 Antagonism scale and conduct an initial examination of its construct and incremental validity. A particular benchmark of evaluation was whether the ANT scale improved upon antagonism measurement vis-à-vis the PSY-5 AGGR scale, which is meant to reflect the same theoretical construct. The findings indicate that the development strategy yielded a scale that covers all consensus features (across AMPD, *ICD-11*, and FFM) and improves upon the AGGR scale with respect to such coverage. The results also indicate that the ANT scale scores evinced generally large correlations with other measures of antagonism across samples, frequently (albeit not exclusively) larger than those for the AGGR scale, and discriminant validity against disinhibition criteria (to the degree expected from antagonism measures generally). There are several specific findings that merit more in-depth discussion.

The results demonstrate that the new MMPI-3 ANT scale is effective at measuring maladaptive antagonism, whereas AGGR likely measures a less dysfunctional variant. Indeed, in comparison to the AGGR scale, the higher associations of ANT scores with PD symptom counts and personality dysfunction more generally (e.g., STIP 5.1 and LPFS 2.0 scores) indicate that the ANT scale measures a more pathological construct than the AGGR scale. This conclusion is further supported by the aforementioned superior incremental validity of AGGR in predicting the nonpathological FFM agreeableness-related criteria above and beyond ANT scores and ostensibly better discriminant validity against disinhibition criteria. The constructs measured by ANT and AGGR are clearly overlapping, as evidenced by the strong associations between them (see [Table S5 in the online supplemental materials](https://doi.org/10.1037/per0000710.supp)), but nonetheless show clear differences in dysfunction. This point is also supported through associations of other measures of antagonism/dissociality with pathological and nonpathological criteria in the New Zealand community mental health sample.2 Another reason the ANT scale extends further into the pathological range of the underlying antagonism dimension in its measurement than AGGR is likely owing to the more extensive coverage of the broader construct. As noted in Study 1, the item content of AGGR is restricted to Crowe et al.’s (2018) antagonism components of callousness and combativeness, whereas the ANT scale items capture a fuller range. Many of the combativeness items on AGGR reflect interpersonal assertiveness, which are less dysfunctional in nature compared to items reflecting immorality, distrust, and arrogance.

The differences in convergent validity for the ANT scale vis-à-vis the AGGR scale are obvious with respect to the general pattern of findings, but the effect size magnitudes were frequently small. This finding is not entirely unexpected given their overlap but deserves some consideration on the degree to which the ANT scale is truly an improvement of PSY-5 AGGR. One could definitely argue that the discriminant validity of AGGR is superior to that of ANT with respect to associations with various disinhibition criteria. Thus, only modest improvements in convergent validity coupled with worse discriminant validity could perhaps lead some readers to conclude that the project failed to deliver. However, we would disagree with such a conclusion because as just mentioned the ANT scale has improved content coverage and clearly measures a more dysfunctional construct, which is important given the purpose of the MMPI-3 more generally. In addition, as also referenced earlier, too much separation from disinhibition actually reflects problematic construct validity. Antagonism and disinhibition are distinct, but related personality constructs, which converge onto a higher-order externalizing domain (e.g., Wright et al., 2012). The associations between ANT and DISC even mirrored those of the other self-reported antagonism and disinhibition measures in these samples better than those for AGGR and DISC.

The current findings also have important implications. Improved coverage and measurement of antagonism places the MMPI-3 in a better position to operationalize the AMPD than do the current PSY-5 scales with AGGR (and better position to measure dissociality among the *ICD-11* PD trait domains). In addition, the ANT scale allows for better measurement of maladaptive low levels of FFM agreeableness, which will allow researchers using the MMPI-3 to connect to that literature as well (e.g., Bagby & Widiger, 2018). Finally, once findings have been replicated in other samples, clinicians can use the MMPI-3 to assess for the antagonism domain, which at maladaptive levels can reflect a number of psychiatric manifestations, including aspects of psychopathic/ antisocial, paranoid, borderline, and narcissistic personality disorder (see Sellbom, 2019, for a review).

The current study also has some important limitations that need to be acknowledged and discussed. First and foremost, a small portion of the criterion measures used in Study 1 for initial item selection were also used as criterion measures for validity purposes in Study 2, and as such, the correlations between the final MMPI-3 ANT scale and those criteria might have been inflated. However, the overall pattern of associations across samples and criterion measures was highly similar, so it is unlikely that this decision had a major impact on the construct validity evaluation. Second, many of the samples used in Study 2 were university samples, which tend to be homogeneous in age, gender, and education when compared to the general population. These samples are also restricted with respect to racial/ ethnic diversity. In addition, the New Zealand community mental health sample consisted of individuals who were predominantly women with self-reported internalizing problems. These sampling issues raise concerns about generalizability to the general population and to other types of clinical or forensic samples including individuals with higher rates of antagonism. Such research will be important for use of the scale in high-stake forensic contexts in which there might be a need to characterize individuals with severe levels of antagonism.

Future research should aim to replicate the current findings in other samples using other types of criterion measures for construct validity. It will be important to examine whether the MMPI-3 ANT scale’s nomological network is similar to what would be expected from the underlying theoretical construct (e.g., Lynam & Miller, 2019). For instance, is this new scale associated with criminal and other forms of antisocial conduct, aggressive behavior, substance misuse, and poor relationship quality? (Johnson et al., 2018; Lamkin & Lavner, 2019; Sleep et al., 2018) It will also be useful for clinicians to see further evidence of the MMPI-3 ANT scale as a transdiagnostic construct as the field shifts away from the outdated reliance of categorical diagnoses (e.g., Hopwood et al., 2018). Finally, it will be important to evaluate whether the scale functions similarly across underrepresented populations through the examination of measurement invariance and differential predictive validity.
