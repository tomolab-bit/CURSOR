\- Enterprises can refer to and apply the accounting voucher system form in Appendix I issued with [Circular 99/2025/TT-BTC](https://thuvienphapluat.vn/van-ban/Doanh-nghiep/Thong-tu-99-2025-TT-BTC-huong-dan-Che-do-ke-toan-doanh-nghiep-565484.aspx) .

The regulations must clearly state the necessity of such amendments and supplements and the enterprise's responsibility before the law for the amended and supplemented contents.

In case the enterprise does not design or modify or supplement the accounting voucher form, it shall apply the accounting voucher system guided in Appendix I issued with [Circular 99/2025/TT-BTC](https://thuvienphapluat.vn/van-ban/Doanh-nghiep/Thong-tu-99-2025-TT-BTC-huong-dan-Che-do-ke-toan-doanh-nghiep-565484.aspx) .
