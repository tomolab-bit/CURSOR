When the opportunity comes, no business owner refuses a business opportunity. But with unexpected opportunities, many times businesses have not yet registered their business in the corresponding industry or profession. So are businesses allowed to do business in those industries or professions? Are they allowed to issue invoices for unregistered industries? Let's learn about the regulations on business, invoice issuance as well as tax risks for unregistered industries with Gonnapass.

## Enterprises are allowed to conduct business in unannounced industries, as long as they are not prohibited industries.

- Enterprises are allowed to conduct business in industries that are not prohibited by law, except for other conditional business cases. (according to Article 7 of the Law on Enterprises)
- Currently, business lines are no longer recorded on the business registration certificate but are recorded on the national business registration information portal at: dangkykinhdoanh.gov.vn

## Penalty for failure to notify or late notification of change of business line

When an enterprise changes or adds to its business lines, it must carry out the procedure of notifying changes to its business registration contents at the Business Registration Office under the Department of Planning and Investment where the enterprise registers its head office **within 10 days from the date of change**.

The regulation on penalties for conducting business in an industry other than that stated in the business registration certificate under Article 7 of Decree 185/2014/ND-CP has been amended by Decree 124/2015/ND-CP, which no longer stipulates penalties for conducting business in an industry other than that stated in the business registration certificate. Instead, businesses will be fined for failing to notify or delaying notification of changes in business lines. ( *Fine from 1,000,000 VND to 5,000,000 VND for late notification of changes from 01 to 30 days;* *Fine from 5,000,000 VND to 10,000,000 VND for late notification from 31 to 90 days; Fine from 10,000,000 VND* *to 15,000,000 VND for late notification from 91 days or more)*

For foreign invested enterprises that are required to register for an investment project registration certificate (IRC), when conducting business in a line of business other than the investment project registration certificate, they must carry out procedures for registering additional lines of business. If they do not properly carry out the procedures for adjusting the investment project and adjusting the investment project registration certificate, the enterprise may be fined.

## Invoices are issued for unregistered business lines.

- \> Enterprises still have to issue invoices for goods and services but have not registered their business lines. See official dispatch 1805/CT-TTHT:

Or **Official Dispatch No. 9833/CT-TTHT**

[![](https://gonnapass.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Capture2.png)](https://gonnapass.com/kinh-doanh-xuat-hoa-don-nganh-nghe-chua-dang-ky/capture2-73/)

- \> At the same time, enterprises are still allowed to declare input VAT for this unregistered business activity (if this is not a conditional or prohibited business activity). If this is a conditional or prohibited business activity, input VAT may not be deducted (according to the guidance in Official Dispatch 1387/TCT-KK in 2015 on value added tax declaration and payment issued by the General Department of Taxation).

*In case Vinkems Company Limited conducts business in an industry or profession that is not listed in the business registration certificate, the Tay Ninh Provincial Tax Department is requested to inspect and determine if the Company's business is not a conditional business or a prohibited business, and agrees with the proposal in Official Dispatch No. 297/CT-TTr dated January 26, 2015 of the Tay Ninh Provincial Tax Department, specifically: accepting the declaration of input VAT for business activities in an industry or profession that is not listed in the business registration certificate of Vinkems Company Limited. The Tay Ninh Provincial Tax Department guides the Company to supplement its business in accordance with regulations.*

## Corporate income tax for unregistered business lines

In the same spirit as declaring input VAT, if the unregistered business activity is not a conditional business line or is prohibited from doing business, the cost of this activity can also be counted as reasonable expenses if it satisfies the conditions for reasonable expenses as prescribed.

However, if the enterprise is eligible for tax incentives, income from unregistered business activities will not be eligible for corporate income tax incentives.
