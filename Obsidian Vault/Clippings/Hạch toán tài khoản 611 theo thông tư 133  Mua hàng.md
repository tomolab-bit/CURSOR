*Instructions [on how to account for Account 611 according to Circular 133](https://ketoannavi.vn/cach-hach-toan-tai-khoan-611-theo-thong-tu-133/), How to account for purchases, value of goods, tools, materials according to the periodic inventory method:*

## 1\. Accounting principles for account 611 – Purchases

a) Account 611 is used to record the value of raw materials, materials, tools, equipment, and goods purchased, stored, or put into use during the accounting period. Account 611 “Purchases” applies to businesses that perform periodic inventory of inventories.

b) The value of purchased raw materials, materials, tools, equipment, and goods must be recorded in account 611 "Purchases" according to the original cost principle.

c) In case the enterprise applies the periodic inventory method for inventory, they must organize periodic inventory to determine the quantity and value of each item, raw material, material, product, tool, and instrument remaining in inventory at the end of the accounting period. This helps determine the value of inventory used and sold during the period.

d) The method of accounting for inventories using the periodic inventory method is as follows: When purchasing raw materials, materials, tools, equipment, or goods, the enterprise relies on purchase invoices, shipping invoices, warehouse receipts, import tax notices payable (or import tax receipts, etc.) to record the original price of purchased goods in account 611 "Purchases." When using or selling goods, record at the end of the accounting period based on inventory results.

d) Accountants need to maintain detailed books to record the original cost of purchased inventory based on each type of raw materials, materials, tools, equipment, and goods.
