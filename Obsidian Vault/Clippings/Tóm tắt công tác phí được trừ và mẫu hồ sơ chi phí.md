## What is a business expense?

![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZimgsnR31p8)

For State-owned enterprises, according to the provisions of Clause 1, Article 3 of Circular 40/2017/TT-BTC and Circular 102/2012/TT-BTC on business trip allowance regime:

*Business trip expenses are expenses paid to people on domestic business trips, including: Travel expenses, accommodation allowance, room rental at the business destination, baggage fees and documents brought for work (if any).*

*Business trip allowance is a state expense that ensures the expenses of people traveling abroad during their business trip…*

Currently, according to legal regulations, there is no official concept of business expenses for non-state enterprises. It can be understood that business expenses are expenses associated with the process of employees going on business trips domestically and internationally, including travel, food, accommodation, etc. to serve the business's operations. Therefore, the constraints on conditions for valid business expenses are implemented according to the Law on Corporate Income Tax and guiding documents.

Note, according to Circular 78/2014/TT-BTC, the level of business travel allowance must not exceed 02 times the level prescribed by the Ministry of Finance for civil servants and public employees. However, from 2015, according to Circular 96/2015/TT-BTC, the level of business travel allowance is no longer limited.
