## Declare items 37 and 38 of the supplementary VAT declaration period

The most common case of these two indicators is that the additional declaration **only increases or decreases the amount of value added tax that can be deducted and transferred to the next period** of the original period (Errors **only** affect the increase or decrease of the indicator \[43\]).

- \> Prepare a supplementary declaration, explanation **on the incorrect declaration of the period:**
- \> On the declaration of **the period in which the error was discovered:**
- \> If indicator \[43\] “KHBS” > 0: Declare the increase difference in indicator \[38\] of the detected period
- \> If indicator \[43\] “KHBS” < 0: Declare the difference in reduction to indicator \[37\] of the detected period

Excerpt from Official Dispatch 1592/CT-NVT on supplementary declaration of tax declaration dossier:

.. *In case the taxpayer makes a supplementary declaration of value-added tax and the result according to the supplementary declaration only increases or decreases the amount of value-added tax not yet deducted **in the tax period with errors**, the supplementary declaration shall be made according to regulations, the amount of value-added tax adjusted to increase or decrease the deduction of the tax period with errors shall be declared in indicator \[38\] "Adjustment to increase the deductible value-added tax of previous periods" or indicator \[37\] "Adjustment to decrease the deductible value-added tax of previous periods" on the value-added tax declaration **of the current tax period** (the period still within the tax declaration period) to satisfy the provisions of Clause 4, Article 7 of Decree No. 126/2020/ND-CP dated October 19, 2020 of the Government.*

## Example of declaring indicators 37, 38

- \> For the second quarter of 2019, our company submitted the first declaration.
- \> On March 2, 2022, our Company discovered that the declaration period for the second quarter of 2019 had **omitted sales invoices** and
	- \>> Prepare **the first supplementary declaration** for the declaration period of the second quarter of 2019 and
	- \>> Adjust to increase indicator 27 on the supplementary declaration. The result on the Supplementary Declaration and Adjustment Explanation (Form 01/KHBS) **increases the VAT payable in the period (indicator 40) and at the same time reduces the VAT amount that can be deducted and transferred to the next period (indicator 43)**.
- \>> The company paid the remaining VAT amount payable in the period (item 40) and paid the late payment amount up to March 2, 2022 (part B. Calculation of late payment amount) on form 01/KHBS.

*Therefore, we respectfully request the General Department of Taxation to answer:*

*1\. Declaration period of the second quarter of 2019. Our company has made a supplementary declaration and paid the increased tax amount and paid the overdue tax amount up to now to remedy the consequences of incorrect declaration of the second quarter of 2019. So, the reduction in the remaining deductible VAT amount transferred to the next period of indicator 43 (form 01/KHBS) on the first supplementary declaration of the second quarter of 2019, must our company declare it in the indicator of adjusting the reduction of the remaining deductible VAT of previous periods (indicator 37) in **the current tax period (declaration period of the first quarter of 2022)** or must we **make a supplementary declaration for the third quarter of 2019 and simultaneously adjust the reduction of the remaining deductible VAT of previous periods (indicator 37) of** this supplementary declaration?*

*2\. If we have to make a supplementary declaration for the 3rd quarter of 2019 and at the same time adjust the deduction of VAT of previous periods (indicator 37) as asked above, does our Company have to make consecutive supplementary declarations for the following periods up to the present time to declare the adjustment to the adjustment to the deduction of VAT of previous periods (indicator 37)? 3. If we have to make consecutive supplementary declarations to declare the adjustment to the adjustment to the deduction of VAT of previous periods (indicator 37) as asked but do not declare the adjustment to the adjustment to the deduction of VAT of previous periods (indicator 37) in the current declaration, will the number of late payment days (if any) only be counted for those consecutive declaration periods and not for the present? Our Company would like to sincerely thank you. Best regards.*

***4\. Additional declaration leading to** **increase** **/decrease in deductible tax***

*4.1. Cases where* *deductions have stopped and tax refunds are requested*

- *\>* Supplementary declaration to adjust **the reduction of** deductible VAT of tax periods with errors **in the tax refund period**, the adjusted deductible VAT amount will be
	- \>> K **two additional tax periods with proposed refund targets** to adjust down the proposed refund amount
	- *\>>* Declare in item 37 *"Adjustment to reduce deductible VAT* *of previous periods* *"* on the VAT declaration **of the current tax declaration period** *.*
	- \>> Enter two in item 38 *"Adjust to increase the deductible VAT amount of previous periods"* on the VAT declaration of the current tax declaration period.
	- \>> In case of a tax refund, when making a supplementary declaration for a tax period with a refund request, the taxpayer must pay the **incorrectly refunded** **tax** **amount** corresponding to the requested refund amount on the declaration and **calculate the late payment fee** from the date the State Treasury signs the confirmation on the State Budget Revenue Refund Order or the State Budget Revenue Refund and Offset Order to the date the taxpayer makes the supplementary declaration.

*Example 7: On the VAT declaration of December 2014, Company C requested a refund of 900 million VND ( refund period from January 2014 to December 2014). Company C was **granted a tax refund** of 900 million VND by the **tax** **authority**.*

*In July 2015, Company C made a supplementary declaration for May 2014 (belonging to the refund period) which reduced the deductible tax amount by 50 million VND due to not meeting the conditions for tax deduction (the VAT declaration for May 2014 had an amount of VAT that had not been fully deducted and transferred to the next period of 120 million VND. Now, the adjustment reduced the amount of VAT that did not meet the conditions for deduction by 50 million VND, resulting in the deductible amount transferred to the next period being 70 million VND) **, then the*** ***adjusted deduction amount decreased by 50 million VND.***

- *\> Additional declaration for tax calculation period December 2014: Adjusting the proposed tax refund amount from 900 million VND to 850 million VND*
- *\> To be included in index 37 **"Adjustment to reduce deductible VAT** **of** **previous** **periods** **"** on the VAT declaration of the tax period of July 2015 ( if still within the tax declaration period ) or August 2015*
- \> The *proposed refund* *amount of 50 million VND is posted to item **38 "Increased adjustment of deductible VAT** **of** **previous periods"** on the VAT declaration of the tax period of July 2015 (if still within the tax declaration period) or August 2015*
- *Determine the amount of tax that has been refunded incorrectly (VND 50 million ) , calculate the late payment fee from the date the State Treasury agency signs the confirmation on the State Budget Revenue Refund Order or the State Budget Revenue Refund and Offset Order to the date of additional declaration in the Additional Declaration Explanation, Adjustment Form No. 01/KHBS attached to the additional declaration dossier for the tax period of December 2014.*

*4.2. In case of additional declaration to reduce deductions or increase payable, leading to ineligibility for tax refund*

- Must calculate late payment on the increased tax amount
- Must pay back the entire amount of incorrectly refunded tax and calculate late payment interest from the date the State Treasury signs the confirmation on the State Budget Revenue Refund Order or the State Budget Revenue Refund and Offset Order to the date the taxpayer makes a supplementary declaration.
- The tax amount that does not meet the conditions for refund but meets the conditions for deduction is declared in **item 38 "Adjustment to increase the amount of deductible VAT of previous periods"** on the VAT declaration of the current tax declaration period.

*Example 8 : Company H proposed to refund 500 million (accumulated deduction from January 2014 to December 2014).*

*In February 2015, Company H was granted a tax refund of 500 million VND by the tax authority. In July 2015 , Company H made a supplementary declaration for the tax period of May 2014 (belonging to the refund period), reducing the deduction amount, leading to an increase in the tax payable of 50 million VND (the VAT declaration of May 2014 had an amount of 100 million VND of VAT that had not been fully deducted and transferred to the next period. Now, the adjustment to reduce the amount of undeductible VAT is 150 million VND, leading to the VAT declaration* *of May 2014 generating a VAT payable of 50 million VND). Company H is not eligible for a tax refund because it has not had 12 consecutive months or more with undeductible input tax.*

Company H made a supplementary declaration as prescribed to pay the increased tax amount of 50 million VND, pay back the tax amount that had been resolved to be refunded by the tax authority of 500 million VND and calculate the late payment fee . The tax amount that does not meet the conditions for refund but meets the conditions for deduction of 400 million VND , Company H was put up to the index "Adjusting the increase in the deductible VAT amount of previous periods" on the declaration of the tax period of July 2015 (if still within the tax declaration period) or the tax period of August 2015.

*4.3.* *In case the taxpayer has stopped deducting and requested a tax refund, but* *the additional tax declaration increases the amount of* *VAT not yet deducted* *in the tax period with errors* *in* *the tax refund period.*

In this case, **additional declaration is not allowed to adjust the amount of tax requested for** **refund** **on** the VAT declaration.

The adjusted deductible tax amount is declared in **item 38 *"Adjusted increase in deductible VAT*** ***of*** ***previous*** ***periods* *"*** on the VAT declaration of the current tax declaration period.

***…6. Some situations** **are declared** **in the "Adjustment to increase/decrease the amount of VAT deductible** **from previous periods** **" on the VAT declaration form.***

6.1. In case a refund request has been made and the **refund is approved**, the tax authority shall issue a Tax Refund Decision with a Notice of non- refundable partial tax amount requested for refund and allow the transfer of further deduction declaration :

Based on the Notice of Non- Refund from the tax authority , the taxpayer declares the amount of tax to be deducted in the "Adjustment to increase deductible VAT of previous periods" on the VAT declaration of the tax period receiving the notice from the tax authority .

*Example 11: On the VAT declaration of April 2015, Company M stopped deducting and prepared a request for a refund of 800 million VND. The tax authority issued a Decision on tax refund on June 2, 2015 with the refunded tax amount being 600 million VND, accompanied by a Notice of non-refund dated June 2, 2015, in which the deduction was 150 million VND, the non-refundable amount was 50 million VND due to the lack of payment documents via bank.*

*Based on the Notice of non- refund , Company M declares the deductible tax amount of 150 million VND in **the indicator "Adjustment to increase the** **deductible** **VAT** **amount** **of previous periods** **" (indicator 38)** **on the VAT** declaration of May 2015 (if still within the tax declaration period ) or the declaration of June 2015.*

6.2. In case the tax authority or competent authority issues a conclusion or decision on tax handling related to an increase or decrease in the amount of deductible VAT, the taxpayer shall base on the conclusion or decision on tax handling to declare in item 38 "Adjustment to increase/decrease **deductible** **VAT** **of previous periods"** on the VAT declaration of the tax period in which the conclusion or decision on tax handling is received .

*Example 12: In August 2015 , Company N received a Decision on handling tax violations through an inspection of tax law compliance in 2014, in which the adjusted reduction of deductible VAT of 2014 was 100 million VND. Company N declared the adjusted reduction in the "Adjusted reduction of deductible VAT of previous periods" indicator on the VAT declaration of the tax period of August 2015 (if still within the tax declaration period) or the declaration of September 2015.*

6.3. Taxpayers newly established from investment projects, when receiving the handover of VAT from the investment project owner, shall declare in the item "Adjustment to increase the deductible VAT amount of previous periods" on the 01/GTGT declaration of the tax period receiving the handover.

Taxpayers newly established from investment projects that start production and business activities with the input VAT amount not yet fully deducted of the investment project being less than 300 million VND shall declare the VAT amount not yet fully deducted of the investment project in the indicator "Adjusting to increase the deductible VAT amount of previous periods" on the 01 /GTGT declaration of the tax period when production and business activities begin.

Taxpayers shall make VAT refunds according to the provisions of Clause 1, Article 18 of Circular No. 219/2013/TT-BTC dated December 31, 2013 of the Ministry of Finance. The tax refund period is determined from the time of declaration in item 38 "Adjustment to increase the deductible VAT amount of previous periods " on declaration form 01/GTGT.

6.4. Taxpayers receiving the remaining deductible VAT from merged units or converted business types shall declare in the item "Adjustment to increase the remaining deductible VAT of previous periods" on the 01/GTGT declaration of the tax period receiving the Notice of tax obligation transfer.

**7\. Some other situations**

*c) In case the taxpayer has stopped deducting and prepared a tax refund request to send to the tax authority but has not yet received a refund, the taxpayer must have a written explanation clearly stating the tax amount requested for refund, the tax amount not requested for refund due to self-eliminating a number of invoices that do not meet the refund conditions of one or more tax periods in the tax refund period. The tax authority shall consider the refund based on the refund request and the taxpayer's written explanation, and shall not require the taxpayer to declare additional months in the tax refund period to adjust the deduction amount.*

*d ) In case , during the inspection and examination of tax obligation compliance at the taxpayer's headquarters, the inspection and examination team discovers an increase in the amount of VAT payable or a decrease in the amount of deductible VAT, the taxpayer's VAT obligation shall be re-determined from the tax period in which the increase in the amount of VAT payable or the decrease in the amount of deductible VAT is discovered until the end of the inspection and examination period and violations shall be handled according to regulations.*

*Example 14 : In August 2015, during the inspection of tax law compliance in 2014 at Company X, the tax authority discovered an adjustment to reduce the amount of VAT deductible on the July 2014 declaration from 200 million VND to 100 million VND. The tax authority then re-determined the VAT liability from July 2014 according to the amount of VAT deductible to be transferred to the next period of 100 million VND until the end of the inspection period (December 2014) and handled the violation according to regulations.*

## Declare index 38 when merging

See Official Dispatch 81913/CT-TTHT dated September 9, 2024

*In case the merged party has been inspected by the directly managing tax authority to determine the* *tax obligations up to the time of termination of operations, including confirmation of the amount of input VAT* *not yet fully deducted of the merged company transferred to the acquiring company,* *the acquiring company shall declare the amount of input VAT not yet fully deducted of the merged party* *in index 38 on declaration form No. 01/GTGT of the tax period receiving the Notice* *of transfer of tax obligations.*
