On October 13, the Economic Police Department, Ho Chi Minh City Police Department, decided to prosecute the criminal case, prosecute the accused and issue an arrest warrant for Vo Thi Ngoc Ngan (nickname "Ngan 98"), operator of ZuBu Trading and Service Company Limited and ZuBu shop business household for the crime of "Producing and trading in counterfeit food products" under Article 193 of the Penal Code.

Since 2021, Vo Thi Ngoc Ngan has begun cooperating with a number of factories in Hanoi to order the processing of "health protection and weight loss" food products such as: Super Detox X3, X7, X1000... On paper, these are all licensed products. However, Ngan has taken advantage of the "free gift" form to sell another product called "Collagen vegetable pills". Through investigation, this "Collagen vegetable pill" is not licensed for circulation, there is no product declaration file, but Ngan still packaged and labeled it with the same brand name X3 - X7 - X1000, then advertised it as having the effect of increasing weight loss when used with the main products.

The authorities have appraised and determined that the products produced and sold by Vo Thi Ngoc Ngan do not meet the declared quality standards and are counterfeit; some samples (collagen tablets) contain the banned substances sibutramine and phenolphthalein. These are active ingredients banned from use in food because they can cause cardiovascular disorders, high blood pressure, digestive disorders and potential cancer risks, seriously affecting the health of consumers. According to data provided by delivery units, in the period 2023 - 2024, revenue from counterfeit sales will amount to hundreds of billions of VND.
