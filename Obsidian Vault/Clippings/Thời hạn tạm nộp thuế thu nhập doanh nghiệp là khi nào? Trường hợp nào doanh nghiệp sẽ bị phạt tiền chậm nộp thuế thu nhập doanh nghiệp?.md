## When is the deadline for provisional payment of corporate income tax?

Pursuant to [Point g, Clause 6, Article 8 of Decree 126/2020/ND-CP](https://thuvienphapluat.vn/van-ban/Thue-Phi-Le-Phi/Nghi-dinh-126-2020-ND-CP-huong-dan-Luat-Quan-ly-thue-455733.aspx?anchor=diem_g_6_8), amended by [Clause 5, Article 1 of Decree 91/2022/ND-CP,](https://thuvienphapluat.vn/van-ban/Thue-Phi-Le-Phi/Nghi-dinh-91-2022-ND-CP-sua-doi-Nghi-dinh-126-2020-ND-CP-huong-dan-Luat-Quan-ly-thue-516302.aspx?anchor=khoan_5_1) stipulating the types of taxes declared monthly, quarterly, annually, each time tax obligations arise and tax finalization declaration as follows:

> ***Types of taxes declared monthly, quarterly, annually, each time tax liability arises and tax finalization***

> *...*

> *g) Foreign transport companies' corporate income tax is provisionally paid quarterly and declared for annual settlement. The total amount of corporate income tax provisionally paid for 04 quarters must not be less than 80% of the corporate income tax payable according to the annual settlement. In case the taxpayer pays less than the amount of tax provisionally paid for 04 quarters, he/she must pay late payment interest calculated on the tax underpaid from the day following the last day of the deadline for provisional payment of corporate income tax for the 04th quarter to the day immediately preceding the date of payment of the remaining tax to the state budget.*

> *...*

According to [Clause 1, Article 55 of the Law on Tax Administration 2019,](https://thuvienphapluat.vn/van-ban/Thue-Phi-Le-Phi/Luat-quan-ly-thue-2019-387595.aspx?anchor=dieu_55) the tax payment deadline is as follows:

> ***Tax payment deadline***

> *1\. In case the taxpayer calculates tax, the deadline for tax payment is the last day of the deadline for submitting tax declaration. In case of supplementary tax declaration, the deadline for tax payment is the deadline for submitting tax declaration of the tax period containing errors or omissions.*

> *For corporate income tax, provisional payment is made quarterly, the latest deadline for tax payment is the 30th of the first month of the following quarter.*

> *For crude oil, the deadline for paying resource tax and corporate income tax on crude oil sales is 35 days from the date of sale for domestically sold crude oil or from the date of customs clearance of goods according to the provisions of the law on customs for exported crude oil.*

> *For natural gas, the deadline for paying resource tax and corporate income tax is monthly.*

> *...*

Accordingly, the regulation allows the final deadline for provisional payment to be the last day of the fourth quarter provisional payment deadline, which is January 30 of the following year.

After this deadline, if the full 80% is not paid, late payment fees will be charged on the tax underpayment.

## In which cases will a business be fined for late payment of corporate income tax?

According to [Clause 1, Article 59 of the Law on Tax Administration 2019,](https://thuvienphapluat.vn/van-ban/Thue-Phi-Le-Phi/Luat-quan-ly-thue-2019-387595.aspx?anchor=dieu_59) the handling of late tax payment is regulated as follows:

> ***Dealing with late tax payment***

> *1\. Cases requiring late payment include:*

> *a) Taxpayers pay taxes late compared to the prescribed deadline, the extended deadline for tax payment, the deadline stated in the tax authority's notice, the deadline in the tax assessment decision or the tax authority's handling decision;*

> *b) Taxpayers who supplement their tax declaration dossiers to increase the amount of tax payable, or the tax administration agency or competent state agency conducting the inspection discovers that they have under-declared the amount of tax payable, must pay late payment fees for the increased amount of tax payable from the day following the last day of the tax payment deadline of the tax period in which the error or omission occurred, or from the date of expiration of the tax payment deadline of the original customs declaration;*

> *c) Taxpayers who supplement their tax declaration dossiers to reduce the amount of tax refunded, or the tax administration agency or competent state agency conducting inspections or audits discovers that the amount of tax refunded is less than the amount of tax refunded, must pay late payment fees for the amount of tax refunded to be recovered from the date of receiving the refund from the state budget;*

> *d) Cases of paying tax arrears in installments as prescribed in Clause 5, Article 124 of this Law;*

> *d) In case of not being subject to administrative sanctions for tax management violations due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for sanctions, but the tax arrears as prescribed in Clause 3, Article 137 of this Law must be collected;*

> *e) Cases where no administrative sanctions are imposed for tax management violations for the acts specified in Clauses 3 and 4, Article 142 of this Law;*

> *g) Agencies and organizations authorized by tax authorities to collect taxes that are late in transferring tax, late payment fees, and fines from taxpayers to the state budget must pay late payment fees for the late amount as prescribed.*

> *...*

Accordingly, enterprises will be fined for late payment of corporate income tax in the cases specified in Clause 1, Article 59 above.

## How are the late payment interest rates and late payment interest periods for corporate income tax regulated?

Pursuant to [Clause 2, Article 59 of the Law on Tax Administration 2019](https://thuvienphapluat.vn/van-ban/Thue-Phi-Le-Phi/Luat-quan-ly-thue-2019-387595.aspx?anchor=dieu_59), amended by Clause 7, [Article 6 of the Law amending the Law on Securities, the Law on Accounting, the Law on Independent Audit, the Law on State Budget, the Law on Management and Use of Public Assets, the Law on Tax Administration, the Law on Personal Income Tax, the Law on National Reserves, the Law on Handling of Administrative Violations 2024,](https://thuvienphapluat.vn/van-ban/Thue-Phi-Le-Phi/Luat-sua-doi-Luat-Chung-khoan-Ke-toan-Ngan-sach-Nha-nuoc-Thue-thu-nhap-ca-nhan-2024-622318.aspx?anchor=dieu_6) the provisions on handling late tax payment are as follows:

> ***Dealing with late tax payment***

> *...*

> *2\. The amount of late payment interest and the time for calculating late payment interest are prescribed as follows:*

> *a) The late payment fee is 0.03%/day calculated on the amount of late tax payment;*

> *b) The time for calculating late payment interest is calculated continuously from the day following the last day of the tax payment deadline, tax payment extension deadline, the deadline stated in the tax notice or tax assessment decision or handling decision of the tax authority to the day immediately preceding the day the tax debt, tax refund, additional tax, assessed tax, or late tax is paid to the state budget.*

> *...*

Thus, the late payment interest rate is 0.03%/day calculated on the amount of late tax payment.

The time for calculating late payment interest is calculated continuously from the day following the last day of the tax payment deadline, tax payment extension deadline, the deadline stated in the tax notice or tax assessment decision or handling decision of the tax authority to the day immediately preceding the day the tax debt, tax refund, additional tax, assessed tax, or late tax is paid to the state budget.
