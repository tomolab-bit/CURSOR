## How many dependents can a person have when calculating family deductions?

Pursuant to Section c2, Point c, Clause 1, Article 9 [of Circular 111/2013/TT-BTC,](https://thuvienphapluat.vn/van-ban/Thue-Phi-Le-Phi/Thong-tu-111-2013-TT-BTC-Huong-dan-Luat-thue-thu-nhap-ca-nhan-va-Nghi-dinh-65-2013-ND-CP-205356.aspx?anchor=dieu_9) the following deductions are stipulated:

> ***Deductions***

> *Deductions as guided in this Article are amounts deducted from an individual's taxable income before determining taxable income from salaries, wages, and business. Specifically as follows:*

> *1\. Family deduction*

> *According to the provisions of Article 19 of the Law on Personal Income Tax; Clause 4, Article 1 of the Law amending and supplementing a number of articles of the Law on Personal Income Tax; Article 12 of Decree No. 65/2013/ND-CP, family deductions are implemented as follows:*

> *...*

> *c) Principles for calculating family deductions*

> *...*

> *c.2) Family deduction for dependents*

> *...*

> *c.2.4) Each dependent can only be deducted once for one taxpayer in a tax year. In case many taxpayers have the same dependent to support, the taxpayers must agree to register the family deduction for one taxpayer.*

> *...*

Thus, according to the above provisions, the law only stipulates that each dependent can only be deducted once per taxpayer in a tax year. There is no regulation limiting the maximum number of dependents that a person can have when considering family deductions in personal income tax.

Therefore, in the personal income tax year, taxpayers may have one or more dependents if such dependents meet the conditions for family deduction as prescribed by law.

## Can I register the same dependent for personal income tax deduction?

Pursuant to the provisions in Section c.2, Point c, Clause 1, Article 9 [of Circular 111/2013/TT-BTC](https://thuvienphapluat.vn/van-ban/Thue-Phi-Le-Phi/Thong-tu-111-2013-TT-BTC-Huong-dan-Luat-thue-thu-nhap-ca-nhan-va-Nghi-dinh-65-2013-ND-CP-205356.aspx?anchor=dieu_9) (the contents related to personal income tax for business individuals in this Article are abolished by Clause 6, Article 25 of [Circular 92/2015/TT-BTC](https://thuvienphapluat.vn/van-ban/Thue-Phi-Le-Phi/Thong-tu-92-2015-TT-BTC-huong-dan-thue-gia-tri-gia-tang-thue-thu-nhap-ca-nhan-282089.aspx?anchor=dieu_25) ) as follows:

> ***Deductions***

> *Deductions as guided in this Article are amounts deducted from an individual's taxable income before determining taxable income from salaries, wages, and business. Specifically as follows:*

> *1\. Family deduction*

> *According to the provisions of Article 19 of the Law on Personal Income Tax; Clause 4, Article 1 of the Law amending and supplementing a number of articles of the Law on Personal Income Tax; Article 12 of Decree No. 65/2013/ND-CP, family deductions are implemented as follows:*

> *...*

> *c) Principles for calculating family deductions*

> *...*

> *c.2) Family deduction for dependents*

> *...*

> *c.2.4) Each dependent can only be deducted once for one taxpayer in a tax year. In case many taxpayers have the same dependent to support, the taxpayers must agree to register the family deduction for one taxpayer.*

> *...*

Thus, according to the above regulations on the principle of calculating family deductions, each dependent is only deducted once per taxpayer in the tax year.

Therefore, in case many taxpayers have the same dependent to support, the taxpayers shall agree to register family deduction for one taxpayer.
