##   
**1\. Violation of agreements on trade and technology secrets**

According to Clause 2, Article 21 of the 2019 Labor Code, when entering into a labor contract, if the employee's work is directly related to the company's business or technology secrets, the employer has the right to reach a written agreement with the employee on the contents related to the protection of those secrets.

Pursuant to [Clause 2, Article 4 of Circular 10/2020/TT-BLDTBXH](https://luatvietnam.vn/lao-dong/thong-tu-10-2020-noi-dung-hdld-cong-viec-anh-huong-xau-toi-sinh-san-196793-d1.html) , the agreement on protection of business and technology secrets may include the following main contents:

> *a) List of trade secrets and technological secrets;*
> 
> *b) Scope of use of trade secrets and technological secrets;*
> 
> *c) Term of protection of business secrets and technological secrets;*
> 
> *d) Methods of protecting business secrets and technological secrets;*
> 
> *d) Rights, obligations and responsibilities of employees and employers during the period of protection of business secrets and technological secrets;*
> 
> *e) Handling of violations of agreements on protection of business secrets and technological secrets* .

If the employee violates the agreement, the company has the right to handle the violation and request compensation from the employee according to the agreement.

The level of compensation for damages in this case must also be based on the fault, the extent of damage and the actual circumstances of the family, personal status and property of the employee.

##   
**2\. Unilateral termination of labor contract illegally**

According to Article 35 of the 2019 Labor Code, employees have the right to unilaterally terminate the labor contract but must ensure there is a statutory reason or have notified the employer in advance.

In case of sudden resignation, the employee will be considered to have unilaterally terminated the contract illegally.

At that time, the employee will have to compensate the employer according to the provisions of Article 40 of the 2019 Labor Code as follows:

\- Compensation of half a month's salary according to the labor contract.

\- Compensate an additional amount of salary according to the labor contract corresponding to the days of no notice.

\- Reimbursement of training costs if during the working process the employee is sent to vocational training or apprenticeship from the employer's budget.

In addition to having to pay compensation, employees who unilaterally terminate their contracts illegally also face disadvantages when they do not receive severance pay or unemployment benefits.

**3\. Damage to tools, equipment, and company property**
