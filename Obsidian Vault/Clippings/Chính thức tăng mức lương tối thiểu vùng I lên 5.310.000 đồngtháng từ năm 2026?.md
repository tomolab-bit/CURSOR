## **Officially increase the minimum wage in region I to 5,310,000 VND/month from 2026?**

On November 10, 2025, the Deputy Prime Minister, on behalf of the Government, issued Decree 293/2025/ND-CP (effective from January 1, 2026) stipulating the minimum wage for employees working under labor contracts.

**[Download](https://thuvienphapluat.vn/ma-so-thue/phap-luat-thue/#)** **Decree 293/2025/ND-CP**

Accordingly, Article 3 of Decree 293/2025/ND-CP stipulates the minimum monthly wage and minimum hourly wage for employees working for employers by region as follows:

| **Region** | **Minimum monthly wage (Unit: VND/month)** | **Minimum hourly wage (Unit: VND/hour)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Region I** | **5,310,000** | **25,500** |
| Region II | 4,730,000 | 22,700 |
| Region III | 4,140,000 | 20,000 |
| Region IV | 3,700,000 | 17,800 |

**Thus, from January 1, 2026, region I will have its basic salary increased to VND 5,310,000/month and VND 25,500/hour.**

*Officially increase the minimum wage in region I to 5,310,000 VND/month from 2026? (Image from the Internet)*

## **From 2026, how much salary is required to pay personal income tax?**

According to Article 7 and Article 9 [of Circular 111/2013/TT-BTC,](https://thuvienphapluat.vn/van-ban/Thue-Phi-Le-Phi/Thong-tu-111-2013-TT-BTC-Huong-dan-Luat-thue-thu-nhap-ca-nhan-va-Nghi-dinh-65-2013-ND-CP-205356.aspx?anchor=dieu_7) taxable income from salaries and wages is regulated as follows:

**Taxable income = Total income – (Compulsory social insurance (10.5%) + Personal family deductions + Deductions for dependents)**

Accordingly, employees' salaries, after deducting deductible amounts, must reach the taxable income threshold before they must pay personal income tax.

At the same time, Article 1 [of Resolution 110/2025/UBTVQH15](https://thuvienphapluat.vn/van-ban/Thue-Phi-Le-Phi/Nghi-quyet-110-2025-UBTVQH15-muc-giam-tru-gia-canh-thue-thu-nhap-ca-nhan-665865.aspx?anchor=dieu_1) (effective from January 1, 2026) stipulates the family deduction level of personal income tax as follows:

> ***Personal income tax family deduction***

> *Adjust the family deduction level prescribed in Clause 1, Article 19 of the Law on Personal Income Tax as follows:*

> *a) The deduction for taxpayers is 15.5 million VND/month (186 million VND/year);*

> *b) The deduction for each dependent is 6.2 million VND/month.*

**Therefore** , according to the above regulations, from 2026, taxpayers must pay personal income tax when:

\- Taxpayers who have no dependents and have an income of 15.5 million VND/month or more after deducting deductions must pay personal income tax.

\- In case of having 1 dependent, the family deduction for each person is 6.2 million VND, then the taxpayer must have an income of 21.7 million VND/month after deducting the deductible amounts to pay personal income tax.

\- In case of 2 dependents, the family deduction for each person is 12.4 million VND, then the taxpayer must have an income of 27.9 million VND/month after deducting the deductible amounts to pay personal income tax.

## **Which income from wages and salaries are subject to personal income tax?**

Pursuant to Clause 2, Article 3 [of the Law on Personal Income Tax 2007,](https://thuvienphapluat.vn/van-ban/Thue-Phi-Le-Phi/Luat-thue-thu-nhap-ca-nhan-2007-04-2007-QH12-59652.aspx?anchor=dieu_3) amended by Clause 1, Article 1 [of the Law on Personal Income Tax 2012](https://thuvienphapluat.vn/van-ban/Thue-Phi-Le-Phi/Luat-thue-thu-nhap-ca-nhan-sua-doi-2012-26-2012-QH13-152719.aspx?anchor=chuong_1) , amended by Clause 1, Article 2 [of the Law on Amending Tax Laws 2014,](https://thuvienphapluat.vn/van-ban/Thue-Phi-Le-Phi/Luat-sua-doi-cac-Luat-ve-thue-2014-259208.aspx?anchor=dieu_2) it is stipulated as follows:

> ***Taxable income***

> *Income subject to personal income tax includes the following types of income, except for tax-exempt income specified in Article 4 of this Law:*

> *1\. Business income, including:*

> *a) Income from production and trading of goods and services;*

> *b) Income from independent practice of individuals with a license or practice certificate as prescribed by law.*

> *Business income specified in this clause does not include income of households and individuals engaged in production and business with revenue below the level specified in Clause 25, Article 5 of the Law on Value Added Tax.*

> *2\. Income from salaries and wages, including:*

> *a) Salaries, wages and amounts of the nature of salaries and wages;*

> *b) Allowances and subsidies, except for: allowances and subsidies according to the provisions of law on preferential treatment for people with meritorious services; national defense and security allowances; toxic and dangerous allowances for industries, occupations or jobs in workplaces with toxic and dangerous factors; attraction allowances, regional allowances according to the provisions of law; allowances for sudden difficulties, allowances for work-related accidents and occupational diseases, one-time allowances for childbirth or adoption, allowances for reduced working capacity, one-time pensions, monthly pensions and other allowances according to the provisions of law on social insurance; severance allowances, unemployment allowances according to the provisions of the Labor Code; social protection allowances and other allowances and subsidies not in the nature of salaries and wages according to the provisions of the Government*
